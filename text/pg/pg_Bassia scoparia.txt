Caution: This plant can be toxic.  
Uses  
Wildlife and Livestock:  During early stages of growth, 
Bassica  scoparia  is palatable and has high forage value 
for all classes of livestock and can be hayed or grazed 
(Everitt et al., 1983; Stubbendieck et al., 2003).     
   Kochia provides cover and the seeds are used as food by 
both songbirds and upland game birds (Stubbendie
ck et 
al., 2003).  The large quantity of high protein seed makes 
kochia valuable for poultry feed (Friesen et al., 2009).  
Kochia is also eaten by deer and pronghorn 
(Stubbendieck et al., 2003).   
  
Erosion Control and Bioremediation:  Kochia can be 
used fo r control of soil erosion. Undersander et al. (1990) 
indicated that it is able to survive in a variety of harsh 
soil conditions, including sandy and alkaline soils.  
Bassica  scoparia  is drought, salinity, and grasshopper 
tolerant and is able to grow in are as with very thin topsoil 
(Friesen et al., 2009).  It is especially suited to arid to 
semi -arid regions (Friesen et al., 2009).  It has the ability 
to germinate and grow at any time  during the growing 
season and will provide quick groundcover to protect th e 
topsoil.    
  
Kochia has been shown to bioaccumulate cesium -137 
(Lasat et al., 1997) and may be able to be used for 
remediation of hydrocarbon contaminated soil (Robson et 
al., 2004).   
  
Ethnobotanic:  Bassica  scoparia has been used in 
Chinese and Korean folk medicine as treatment for skin 
diseases, diabetes, mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, liver 
disorders, and jaundice (Kim et al., 2005; Choi et al., 
2002).  In Japan and China the fresh fruit is used as a 
food garnish on some dishes (Yoshikawa et al., 1997) 
and the seeds are ground into flour (Usher, 1974).  In 
China, Russia, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania, and Italy 
kochia is planted for making brooms (Zimdahal, 1989; 
Shu, 2003; Nedelcheva et al., 2007; Friesen et al., 2009).   
  
Kochia seeds contain an oviposition pheromone that can 
be added as an attractant for mosquito pesticides (Friesen 
et al., 2009; Whitney et al., 2004).  The seeds of kochia 
have also been shown to contain other chemicals that 
could have beneficial human uses, such as compounds 
that co uld be used  to treat ulcers, rheumatoid arthritis, 
and some human pathogenic bacteria (Friesen et al., 
2009; Goyal and Gupta, 1988; Borrelli and Izzo, 2000).   
  
Bassica  scoparia  is grown as an ornamental due to its 
dense and conical shape as well as its bright red color in 
the fall (Undersander et al., 1990).

Weediness  
This plant may become weedy or invasive in some 
regions or habitats and may displace desirable vegetation 
if not properly managed.  Please consult with your local 
NRCS Field Office, Cooperative Extension Service 
office, state natural resource, or state agriculture 
department regarding its status and use.  Weed 
information is also available from the PLANTS Web site 
at plants.usda.gov.  Please consult the Related Web Sites 
on the Plant Profile for this species for further 
informa tion.  
  
When kochia matures it breaks off at the base of the plant 
and becomes a tumbleweed which helps disperse the 
seed.  Forcella (1985) concluded that due to this 
tumbleweed mode of dispersal, kochia had the highest 
rate of spread among alien weed species in the western 
United States from 1880 and 1980.   
   
Description   
General : Goosefoot Family (Chenopodiaceae).  Kochia is 
an introduced, erect, annual forb with a taproot that forms 
pyramidal or rounded bushes up to 7 feet (2.1 m) tall.  
Phillips and La unchbaugh (1958) reported that the roots 
of  Bassica  scoparia  can reach a depth of at least 8 feet 
(2.4 m) and have a horizontal radius of at least 8 feet (2.4 
m) which would allow the plant to draw water from a 
cylindrical soil mass 16 feet (4.9 m) in diam eter and 8 
feet (2.4 m) or more deep.    
   
The leaves have alternate arrangement and are simple, 
linear to narrowly ovate to 5.5 cm long and can have 
hairs, depending on age.  Leaves are very short petioled 
or sessile.  The leaves have 1 -5 prominent veins w ith 
entire margins fringed with hairs.  Stem is green, red 
tinged, or red depending on age (Friesen et al., 2009).  
The flowers are green leaf -like bracts and surrounded by 
tufts of hair (Stubbendieck et al., 2003). The 
inflorescence is a spike and is axil lary and terminal.  
Flowers are either perfect with 3 -5 stamens or pistillate 
with both types having two stigmas (Friesen et al., 2009).  
Kochia has utricle fruits with an oval, brown to black 
seed (Stubbendieck et al., 2003).  Kochia varies widely in 
morp hological characters partially due the environment 
where it is found (Friesen et al., 2009).   
   
Distribution :  
Kochia is common throughout the western and northern 
United States (Friesen et al., 2009).  It is also found 
throughout much of Canada, especiall y in the arid and 
semi -arid grasslands (Friesen et al., 2009).  Kochia is also 
found throughout Europe, Africa, and South America, as 
well as parts of, Asia (Friesen et al., 2009).  Although 
once present in Australia it has now been eradicated 
(Natural Res ource Management Ministerial Council, 
2006).   
   
For current distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.   Habitat
:   
Kochia is common in rangelands, pastures, fields, 
disturbed sites, gardens, roadsides, and ditchbanks 
(Stubbendieck et al., 2003; Whitson et al., 1991).  It can 
be found in areas with as little as 6 inches (15.24 cm) of 
annual rainfall (Undersander et al., 1990).   
   
Adaptation   
Kochia is native to central and eastern Europe and Asia 
(Whitson et al., 1991) and was likely introduced as an 
ornamental in the mid - to late 1800’s (Friesen et al., 
2009).   Bassica  scoparia  can be found in a very wide 
range of temperatures and climatic regions throughout 
the world, but is particularly adapted to arid and semi-
arid regions, such as the Canadian prairies and the Great 
Plains region of the United States (Friesen et al., 2009).  
Kochia exhibits early germination that makes it capable 
of utilizing limited spring soil moisture in arid to semi-
arid regions (Eberlein and Fore, 1984).  Germination of 
seeds can occur multiple times throughout the growing 
season (Friesen et al., 2009), enabling it to take 
advantage of moisture when it is available.  Seeds are 
able to germinate under high stress conditions, such as 
lack of moisture, high salinity, or extremes in pH 
(Friesen et al., 2009).       
   
Kochia is a facultative alkali halophyte an d is tolerant of 
thin or high salinity soils or acidic soils due to the 
presence of aluminum or manganese (Friesen et al., 2009; 
Bilski and Foy, 1988).   
   
Establishment   
Undersander et al. (1990) gives the following guidelines 
for seeding and establishment  of Kochia. Soil should 
plowed or disked and weed free. Planting should be done 
late April to early May.  Liming of the soil to a pH of 6.0 
is recommended. Nitrogen equaling 100 –  250 lb N/acre 
(113  – 282.5 kg N/ha) should be applied by applying 50 –  
100 l b/acre (56.5 -  113 kg/ha) before planting and 
topdressing the
 remainder later depending on the 
anticipated yield.  Splitting the application and not 
applying more than 150 lb N/acre (169.5 kg N/ha) at one 
time reduces the possibility of nitrate toxicity.  Suggested 
potash (K
2O) rates are 24 –  50 lb K2O/ton (12 –  25 kg 
K
2O /metric ton) of hay harvested.  Drilling seed at 1 
lb/acre (1.1 kg/ha) in 36 in (91.4 cm) rows should result 
in an adequate stand.  Seeding rates of 1 -4 lb/acre (1.1 to 
4.4 kg/ha) may be necessary  if a thicker stand is desired 
or if broadcast seeding is used.  Seed depth should not 
exceed ¾ in (1.9 cm) deep with the best results around ¼ 
in (0.64 cm) .  Kochia will need to be thinned to prevent it 
from crowding itself out. This can be done b y thinning to 
2 -10 plants/ft of row by chiseling at right angles or 
windrowing portions of the field and allowing livestock 
to graze the dry feed as they graze the green material.  An 
alternate method of thinning is to allow livestock grazing 
for a short t ime when the plants are approximately 2 in. 
(5.08 cm) tall.

Management  
Bassica  scoparia  is palatable to all classes of livestock.  
The nutritional value, when immature, is similar to that 
of alfalfa (Stubbendieck et al., 2003).  Bassica  scoparia 
can be toxic to livestock and may cause death if 
consumed in large quantities by cattle, sheep, or horses 
(Sprowls, 1981).  Kochia has been known to cause 
polioencephalomalacia and photosensitization in range 
cattle (Dickie and Berryman, 1979).  Kochia has been 
identified as containing saponins, alkaloids, oxalates, and 
nitrates all of which are toxic substances that seem to be 
more toxic during times of drought and during seed 
maturity (Dickie and James, 1983), so caution should be 
used when using kochia  as forage for livestock.  It is 
recommended that kochia forage should consist of not 
more than 50% of livestock ration (Mir et al., 1991; 
Saskatchewan Agriculture, 1986).  Kochia stands can be 
grazed by livestock directly but care should be taken to 
preven t poisoning.  Rotational grazing of other crops and 
not grazing for more than 90 -120 days should help 
prevent poisoning (Undersander et al., 1990).  Feeding 
supplemental phosphorus is recommended for livestock 
grazing on kochia due to the low amount that i s present 
in the plant (Undersander et al., 1990).   
   
If kochia is cut for hay or silage it should be cut before it 
has produced seed when it is between 18 –  26 in (45.7  – 
66 cm) tall (Undersander et al., 1990).  Under irrigated 
and fertilized conditions k ochia could be cut up to four 
times a year (Foster, 1980).  Reports of hay production 
has varied from 1 ton/acre (2.25 t/ha) (Hanson 1988) to 
11.5 ton/acre (26 t/ha) (Foster, 1980) depending on 
region, moisture, and fertilization.  
   
If it is cut for hay, it will likely need to be crimped and 
crushed after cutting and is going to take between 10 -30 
days to cure (Hanson, 1988).  Kochia is more resistant to 
spoiling, even with rain, and can be baled at higher 
moisture levels than with other crops (Hanson, 198 8).  If 
hay is harvested when it is too mature and contains 
coarse stalks, then bales will need to be processed (i.e. 
ground) and mixed with other forages for livestock to 
readily consume it (Hanson, 1988).   
   
Pests and Potential Problems  
There are some i nsects that are found to use kochia as a 
food source or host, however, they rarely cause major 
problems to the plants (Friesen et al., 2009). Kochia may 
be host to various fungi some of which can be 
detrimental to crops.  One such fungus is Aphanomyces 
cochlioides  Drechsler, which causes blackroot of 
sugarbeet in Canada (Williams and Asher, 1996). Friesen 
et al. (2009) indicated that kochia may be a host for 
insects that may be vectors for or direct hosts for certain 
bacteria and viruses that can be problem s for some 
agricultural crops such as potatoes and tobacco.

-NRCS. Dry kochia in a wheat 
stubble field.  This plant may break off at the base creating a 
tumbleweed that has the potential to spread seed great distances  from 
where it originated. Riley County, Kansas   
 
Grasses will out -compete kochia (Undersander et al., 
1990).  This can be a good trait if kochia is used for soil 
stabilization and it is desired that perennial grasses 
eventually dominate the site.  However , if the goal is to 
produce kochia as forage rations for livestock, this can be 
problematic.  Currently there is not any herbicide that is 
registered for weed control in kochia.   
   
Volunteer kochia is likely to be a problem in crops that 
are planted follow ing kochia and control will be 
necessary (Undersander et al., 1990).  It has been shown 
that there is at least some herbicide resistance in some 
populations in parts of the United States, Canada, and the 
Czech Republic (Friesen et al., 2009).  Theses 
popul ations have been shown to have at least some 
resistance to one or more of the following:  2, 4- D, 
triazine, auxinic herbicides, dicamba, and sufonylurea 
(Friesen et al., 2009).  Kochia seems to be most 
susceptible to herbicides early in growth, with the 
ef fectiveness lessening as the plant matures (Friesen et 
al., 2009; Eberlein and Fore, 1984).   
   
Environmental Concerns   
Kochia is highly invasive and is able to establish and 
persist in harsh environments were other plants are 
limited.  Kochia scoparia  has been shown to be one of 
the most widespread annual weeds in Kansas, Nebraska, 
Southern Canadian prairies, and throughout the Great 
Plains Region (Phillips and Launchbaugh, 1958; 
Blackshaw, 1990; Stubbendieck et al., 2003). Due to the 
tumble weed type spread of seeds and the documented 
herbicide resistance, kochia may be hard to control once 
it is established in an area.

Kochia can become a serious problem in agricultural 
crops, such as sugarbeets, potatoes, alfalfa, and wheat 
(Boerboom, 1993).  Friesen et al. (2009) indicated that 
kochia has some allelopathic properties which inhibit 
growth of other kochia plants and other plant species, 
including common agricultural crops.   
   
Control   
Please contact your local agricu ltural extension specialist 
or county weed specialist to learn what works best in 
your area and how to use it safely.  Always read label and 
safety instructions for each control method.  Trade names 
and control measures appear in this document only to 
prov ide specific information.  USDA NRCS does not 
guarantee or warranty the products and control methods 
named, and other products may be equally effective.  
   
Kochia exhibits leaf characteristics, such as pubescence 
and a wax, which makes absorption of herbic ides 
difficult (Harbour et al., 2003).  Absorption and efficacy 
of herbicides is greatly dependent on the dose applied 
and the maturity of kochia, with herbicides becoming less 
effective as the plant matures.    
   
Some populations have shown resistance to 2, 4- D, 
triazine, auxinic herbicides, dicamba, and sufonylurea 
(Friesen et al., 2009).  The herbicide 2, 4 -D, itself, does 
not provide acceptable control regardless of formulation, 
dose, or the timing of the applic ation (Friesen et al., 
2009).     
   
Seeds and Plant Production   
Germination is possible when the top 1 -1.5 inches of the 
soil become frost free and the soil temperature reaches 
50°F (10°C) (Becker, 1978; Undersander et al., 1990). 
Viability of kochia seed is greatly reduced 1 -2 years after 
production, with germination rates shown to be only 5% 
after one year and 1% after three years, thus preventing 
persistent seed banks of kochia seed (Friesen et al., 
2009).   
   
Seed production is highly variable and depends  on the 
conditions and the competition that the plant endures 
(Friesen et al., 2009).  Stallings et al. (1995) observed 
that field grown kochia can produce anywhere from 
2,000 to 30,000 seeds per plant.  Mature seed is not 
dormant and can germinate immediately under suitable 
conditions (Friesen et al., 2009).  Seed can be harvested 
using a combine (Undersander et al., 1990).  Kochia 
reproduces solely from seed and has no means or 
structures for vegetative reproduction (Friesen et al., 
2009).    
   
Seedlings o f kochia can tolerate frost (Eberlein and Fore, 
1984), but mature plants may not be able to produce 
viable seed in regions with a short frost free growing 
season (Friesen et al., 2009).   
    Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and 
area of origin) 
 
These plant materials are somewhat available from 
commercial sources as an ornamental.  These plant 
materials are not readily available from commercial 
sources for use as livestock forage.
