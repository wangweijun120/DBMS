  Uses
 
Livestock  
Young plants of common reed are considered v ery 
palatable and readily grazed by sheep and cattle 
(Frankenberg, 1997).  Mature plants are tough and 
unpalatable to livestock and wildlife ( Letihead et al., 
1971 ). 
 
Wildlife   
Common reed provides excellent cover  for wildlife 
(Skinner, 2010)  including hiding cover for deer, r abbits, 
pheasants and other animals. Common reed also provides  
n esting cover for wide variety of waterfowl and shoreline 
birds.  Waterfowl eat the seed , and muskrats and nutrias 
eat the rhizomes and stems ( Stubbendieck et al., 2003). 
 
Erosion control  
Due to  its dense root matrix and coarse stems, common 
reed has been r ecommended for shoreline and earthen 
dam stabilization (USDA NRCS, 1999).  It is used by 
mining operations for stabilizing ditch banks (Walker and 
Grimes, 1997).  Common reed has also  been used t o trap 
silt  and improve water quality  (Frankenberg, 1997). 
N ative grass species  are recommended to prevent 
accidental spread of invasive type common reed  
(Saltonstall, 2010) .  Only n ative common reed should be 
used , and it should be used  only where it can be properly 
managed.  
Status  
Common reed is considered an invasive or problematic 
we ed in numerous states. It is a Class C noxious weed in 
Alabama . It is a b anned invasive weed in Connecticut  and 
p rohibited in Massachusetts . Common reed is l abeled a 
plant pest and an invasive aqu atic plant in South Carolina. 
In Vermont it is d esignated as a  Class B noxious weed . 
The state of Washington separated out the non- native 
genotype  from native forms. The invasive form is a class 
C noxious weed  (USDA-NRCS, 2012) . Please consult the 
PLANTS Web site and your State Department of Natural 
Resources for t his plant’s current status ( e.g., threatened 
or endangered species, state  noxious status, and wetland 
indicator values).  
Weediness  
A non -native form of t his plant may become weedy or 
invasive in some regions or habitats and may displace 
desirable vegetatio n if not properly managed.  Please 
consult with your local NRCS Field Office, Cooperative 
Extension Service office, state natural resource, or state 
agriculture department regarding its status and use.  Weed 
information is also available from the PLANTS We b site

Sites on the Plant Profile for this species for further 
information. 
Description  
General :  Grass family (Poaceae). Common reed is a 
large rhizomatous/stoloniferous cool season  grass 
obtaining heights of up to 4 m (13 ft) with stems 
averaging 0.5 to 1.5 cm (0.2 to 0.6 in) in diameter. The 
leaf sheath is open. The ligule is a ring of hairs averaging 
1 to 2 mm ( 0.4 to 0.8 in) in length.  Auricles are absent. 
The leaves are cauline, rolled or flat, and1 to 5 cm ( 2 in) 
wide  and 10 to 60 cm ( 4 to 24 in) long (Hitchcock and 
Cronquist, 1973) . The inflorescence is a loose to tight 
purple tinged 15 to 40 cm ( 6 to 16 in) long panicle. 
Spikelets a re 12 to 15 mm ( 0.5 to 0.6 in) long and several -
flowered . The rachilla (stem between the florets) is 
covered with long silky hairs . Glumes are unequal, 3- to 
5 - nerved and shorter than the florets  (Barkworth et al., 
2007;  Skinner, 2010) . Common reed produc es male, 
female and perfect flowers.  
 
Common reed has an extensive system of scaly rhizomes 
and stolons which allow the plants to spread into dense 
monotypic stands.  Stolons have been measured up to 18 
m  (60  ft) long (Welsh et al., 2003) .  The rhizomes 
pro duce a dense mat that ranges from 10 cm ( 4 in)   to 2.5 
m ( 8 ft) below  the  soil  surface (Gucker, 2008).  Rhizome 
depth is dependent on site conditions.  
 
There are three taxa or lineages of common reed found in 
the United States. The broadly distributed nati ve (P. 
australis  ssp.  americanus ) covers most of the United 
States and portions of southern  Canada. The Gulf Coast 
type (ssp berlandieri ) occurs in southern U.S. and 
Mexico. The nativity of this subspecies is  uncertain. It 
m ay  be a relatively recent migran t from Mesoamerica 
(Barkworth et al., 2007) . The third type is native  to 
Eurasia  and has become  invasive in most of the U.S. This 
taxon has not been officially named  to subspecies as its 
relationships are  unclear  (Barkworth et al., 2007).  It will 
hereafter  be referred to as “invasive type.”  Swearingen 
and Saltonstall (2010) provide images for distinguishing 
native and exotic forms. The following key from 
Saltonstall and Hauber (2007) will aid in separation of the 
three taxa.

Distribution :  
Common reed has been described as the m ost broadly 
distributed flowering plant in the world (Good, 1974). It 
is f ound on every continent except Antarctica  (Gucker, 
2008).  Subspe cies americanus  is native to North America  
occurring in much of the US with the exception of the 
southeastern states . A second subspecies  berlandieri is 
found along the southern edge of the United States from 
California to Florida. The non- native form was introduced 
into North America in the early 19
th  century (Saltonstall, 
2002).  It established first along the Atlantic coast and 
moved  westward with the westward  human expansion , 
likely  spread ing with aid of roadway and railroad 
development in late 19
th  and  early 20th centuries 
(Saltonstall, 2002). Common reed (in the broad est sense) 
is currently f ound in all states but Alaska (USDA NRCS, 
2012).  Refer to Saltonstall et al. (2004) for distribution 
maps of the three lineages. For current distribution, please 
co nsult the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site.  
Habitat :  Common reed occupies a variety of habitats 
throughout its range including tidal and non -tidal 
wetlands, marshes, springs, seeps,  riparian and lacustrine 
areas from sea level to  7,000 ft ( Hickman, 1993;  Welsh  
et.al., 2003 ).  
Common reed often occupies disturbed sites forming  
monotypic stands, although the native subspecies are less 
likely to form dense stands than the invasive type . It is a 
dominant species in several vegetation types in the US 
and Canada. Because of its vast distribution, common 
reed grows in association with a wide variety of species  
associated with wetland and riparian plant communities . 
Ethnobotany  
Common reed was used extensively by Native Americans. 
The plan ts were used medicinally to treat diarrhea, and 
made into a poultice to treat boils (University of 
Michigan, 2012). Several tribes used common reed for 
building and weaving material from which they made 
mats, baskets, arrow shafts, flutes and rafts (Univer sity of 
Michigan, 2012). The seed was eaten as food, and the 
sugary sap from common reed was heated into a ball and 
dried to be eaten like candy (University of Michigan, 
2012).  
Adaptation  
Common reed is adapted to a wide range of soil 
conditions from fine  to coarse soil types. It is a dapted to

anaerobic conditions and soils with a pH range  of  3.7  to 
8.7 ( Chabreck, 1972;  USDA NRCS, 2012).  Common reed 
is found in highly  salin e areas including s alty tidal 
marshes  and  inland saline playas.  The invasive  type  is 
more tolerant to salinity than the  native lineages . 
Common reed is also adapted to f requent, prolonged 
flooding; however plant mortality has been reported  after 
3 or more years with more than 1 m ( 3 ft) of water ( Shay 
and Shay, 1986).  
Establishment  
Common  reed is established using stem cuttings or 
rhizomes (Frankenberg, 1997). R hizomes should be 
planted into weed free soil that has been tilled to a depth 
of  10  to 15 cm  (4 to 6  in).  Recommendations for rhizome 
spacing vary.  Rhizome sections 30 to 46 cm (12 t o 18 in) 
long should be planted 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 in) deep at a 
rate of 1 rhizome per foot of row. For shoreline erosion 
control plantings, a minimum of three rows are 
recommended at 40 inch row spacing parallel to the 
shoreline  (Texas Agricultural Exper iment Station, 1979). 
Erosion control plantings in northeast Texas reported 
>50% survival using 30 x 60 cm (12 x 24 in) spacing 
( Walker and Grimes 1997 ). 
 
The source area for rhizome collection should share 
similar characteristics to the planting site. Com mon reed 
clones from fresh water sites should not be used in saline 
situations (Frankenberg, 1997).  
Management  
For erosion control plantings it is recommended that 
livestock be excluded from planting sites during 
establishment (Texas Agricultural Experimen t Station, 
1979).  
Pests and Potential Problems  
There are no known pests associated with common reed. 
For information on potential problems, refer to 
“Environmental Concerns.”  
Environmental Concerns  
Native forms of common reed can  form  dense stands  in 
suita ble habitat, but they do not have the weedy 
tendencies of the non -native invasive type. The invasive 
type poses a threat to native wildlife and vegetation.  It 
will crowd out native plants, alter wetland hydrology and 
increase fire potential ( Keller, 2000; Saltonstall, 2010 ). It 
will form dense monocultures spreading by seed into open 
areas and then spreading rapidly vegetatively.  It w ill 
spread by rhizome and stem  fragments carried  on water or 
via machinery  (DiTomaso and Healy, 2003)   
 
Control  
Glyphosate tr eatments are the  best option to reduce or 
control populations of common reed. Young populations 
with a less -developed rhizome network are more easily 
controlled than mature stands. Apply herbicides in late 
summer/early fall after flowering as foliar spray or on cut  stumps. Repeat treatments for several years may be 
necessary to completely kill rhizomes (Saltonstall, 2010). 
 
 
Other c ontrol methods for common reed include deep 
“root burns”. Under typical conditions, common reed will 
be top killed by fire but the rhizomes will persist. Root 
burns require substantial litter accumulation and a 
completely dry rooting area  for successful control . 
Repeated mechanical treatments can decrease growth but 
not cause plant mortality. Burning followed by flooding 
can cause  mortality by eliminating oxygen transport from 
above ground leaves and stems to below surface tissues. It 
is recommended to use fire in conjunction with physical, 
mechanical and chemical control.  
 
Please contact your local agricultural extension specialis t 
or county weed specialist to learn what works best in your 
area and how to use it safely.  Always read label and 
safety instructions for each control method.  Trade names 
and control measures appear in this document only to 
provide specific information.   USDA NRCS does not 
guarantee or warranty the products and control methods 
named, and other products may be equally effective.  
Seed and Plant Production  
Seed production in common reed is variable. DiTomaso 
and Healy (2003) indicate that viable seeds have n ot been 
observed in North American populations. However, 
seedling emergence has been recorded in seed bank 
studies in Utah, Washington and elsewhere ( Comes et al., 
1978;  Smith and Kadlec, 1983 ). 
 
Seed  is dispersed by wind and water; however 
germination fro m seed is rare and dependent on site 
conditions.  Germination requirements include full light, 
warm temperatures and moist but not flooded conditions 
(Gucker, 2003).   
 
Rhizome fragments are the primary means of spread of 
common reed. Rhizomes can be broken apart by 
environmental conditions including wave and wind 
action, or by mechanical disturbance.  Non -native 
rhizome sprouts survived significantly better under higher 
levels of salinity than native genotypes  ( Vasquez et al., 
2005 ). 
 
Commercial availability  of common reed appears to be 
limited to rhizomes. Production fields should be planted 
in rows on sandy soils. Rhizomes can be harvested after a 
single growing season, but two years of growth are 
recommended. The USDA -NRCS  James E. “Bud”  Plant 
Materials Ce nter in Knox City, Texas reported  production 
yields of 75,000 to 100,000 rhizomes per acre per year  
(Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, 1979).  
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin)  
‘Shoreline’ common reed was selected at the James E. 
“Bud” Smith Plant Materials Center in Knox City TX

with the intended use of shoreline stabilization and 
erosion control. It was released in 1978 for its superior 
wave action control and salinity tolerance. Shoreline was 
originally collected from a  railroad right -of -way at 
Lawrence, Texas in 1970. Rhizomatous breeder stock is 
available from the PMC (Alderson and Sharp, 1994).   
 
‘Southwind’ common reed was rele ased in 1988 by the 
NRCS  Manhatta n, Kansas Plant Materials Center and the 
Kansas State Unive rsity Agricultural Experiment Station. 
It is recommended for streambank and shoreline 
stabilization, rehabilitation of polluted waters, filter strips 
and constructed wetlands for sewage and sludge 
treatment.  It is recommended for use in eastern Nebraska, 
Kansas  and Oklahoma.
