Description  
General :  Browntop millet ( Urochloa ramosa) is an 
introduced , annual /perennial  warm -season  grass often 
used in for age/pasture management systems. The stem 
(culm) may be erect or prostrate along the ground. When 
growing erect, it may reach 3 ft at maturity. Nodes will 
appear  minutely hairy.  The lance- shaped , hairless  leaf -
blades are ¾ –10 inches long ( 2–25 cm ) and 1/8– ½ inch 
( 4 –14 mm)  wide  (Clayton et al., 2006) . The inflorescence 
is indeterminate , open, spreading,  with a simple axis and 
stalked flowers. It has  3 –15  inflorescences , ⅓ –3 inches 
( 1 –8 cm ) in length, from a central axis . It has white 
flowers  and ellipsoid seeds that are tan in color . It has 
fibrous roots that can grow to 2 ft deep.  
 
Distribution :  Browntop millet is an introduced grass that 
originated in Southe ast Asia. I t is grown i n Africa, 
western Asia, Arabia,  China, and Australia (Clayton, 
2006).  It was introduced to the United States from India 
in 1915 (Oelke et al., 1990). I n the US, it is mainly grown 
in the Southeast  for hay, pasture, and game  bird feed. For  current 
distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page 
for this species on the PLANTS Web site.  
 
Habitat :  Browntop millet  is a facultative upland (FACU) 
plant that normally occurs in non- wetlands in the Atlantic 
and Gulf Coastal Plain, the Eastern Piedmont, and Great 
Plains.  It grows best in sandy loam soils with a pH 5 –6.5 
(UF, 2007)  under full sun.  
Adaptation  
Browntop millet  grows in rocky, shallow soils from sea 
level up to 8,000 ft (FAO, 2007). It is adaptable to almost 
all upla nd soil (Mitchell e t al., 1989), but does not grow 
well  in water -restricted, droughty conditions. It will not 
survive in temperature less than 52°F.  Generally, 
browntop millet  and pearl millet ( Pennisetum glaucum ) 
are grown in the South/Southe ast United States while 
proso mi llet (Panicum miliaceum ), foxtail millet (Setaria 
italic a), and to a lesser extent Japanese millet 
( Echinochloa frumentaceae ) are mainly grown in the 
Midwest and Central Plains (Oelke et al., 1990) . 
Uses  
Forage /Feed:   Compared to other warm season forage 
grasses , b rowntop millet is  relatively low yielding .  I ts 
strength is that it is a rapidly maturin g grass, often used as 
a  catch crop, cover crop , or nurse crop (Miller and Lord, 
2007).  Browntop millet can yield  1,800 –4,000  lb/ac  dry 
matter  ( FAO, 2007; UF,  2007) . These yields are 60– 70% 
of  pearl mi llet or sorghum x  Sudan grass  hybrids  
(Hancock, 2010). Browntop millet can accumulate 
toxic /lethal  levels of nitrate and should not be fed to 
livestock if the plant has been stressed by droughty or 
cold conditions.  Plantings in Minnesota have produced 
low yields and did not successfully compete with weeds 
(Oelke et al., 1990).  
 
Cover crop/green manure:   Browntop millet is used to 
suppress root -knot nematode  populations in tomato and 
pepper crops in the Southeast (McSorley et al., 1999).  It is 
grown as a fast -growing catch crop between commodity  
crops, and is not  known to be  allelopathic.   
 
Wildlife:   Browntop millet can represent 10– 25%  of the 
diet of terrestrial and water birds  (USDA NRCS, 2014) . It 
is a prolific seed producer that i s planted to attract wild 
game like pheasants, turkeys, and ducks.  In a two -year  
study by Futch, Duguay, and Tolson (2013), 50% of 
inges ted seed found in mourning dove s’ crops was 
browntop millet.  It  is also used in deer food plots and as 
exotic bird feed.  
 
Critical Area Planting:   Browntop millet is used as a fast-
growing cover for erosion control. It is used as a nurse 
crop in the Southeast until a perennial grass cover is 
Natural Resources Conservation Service  Plant Guide

established. Due to its ability to attract granivorous birds 
(e.g.  doves),  it should not be used for construction 
projects near airfields ( Washburn and Seamans, 2013).   
Browntop millet also has the ability to accumulate 
significant amounts of lead  and zinc  in shoot and root 
tissues  making it  an important plant for remediation of 
contaminated soils (Lakshmi et al., 2013).   
Ethnobotany  
There is evidence of the cultivation of browntop millet as 
a subsistence crop in Neolithic India ( Boivin et al., 2014) 
and  it continues t o be used as a grain and forage crop in 
India today (Madella et al., 2013).  Grain from taller non -
shattering vari eties is used as a boiled whole grain, 
porridge, or unleavened bread  (Nesbitt, 2005). 
 
Status  
Weedy or Invasive
:   Browntop millet  can become weedy, 
and may interfere with crop harvest. It produces large 
amounts of seed and can readily  regrow from a viable 
seed bank, even after several years. It has been found to 
reduce yield and lower quality of cotton in the 
southeast ern United States (Molin, 2008). Please consult 
with your local NRCS Field Office, Cooperative 
Extension Service office, state natural resource, or state 
agriculture department regarding its status and use.  
Ple ase consult the PLANTS Web site 
( http://plants.usda.gov/
)  and your State Department of 
Natural Resources for this plant’s current status (e.g., 
threatened or endangered species, state noxious status, 
and wetland indicator values).  
Planting Guidelines 
Browntop millet can be planted in late spring or early 
summer; May 1 –June 15 in Tennessee (Bates et al., 2008)  
or from mid -April –mid -August  in the Southeast  
(Hancock, 2010) . Cold stratification is not required for 
seed germination. The o ptimal air temperature for 
germination is between 63 –79°F  (FAO, 2007) . It g rows 
best in full  sun in light-textured, well -drained soils with 
an optimal pH of 7– 7.5. Recommended seeding rates are 
14– 20 lb/ac drilled and 25 –30  lb/ac broadcast (Mitchell 
and Tomlinson , 1989; MSU, 2010) planted ½  –1 in deep  
(Woodruff et al., 2010) . To avoid overcrowding, seed 
may be diluted with soybean or corn meal before planting 
with  manually operated  seeders  (Schonbeck and Morse, 
2006) . If planted as a nurse crop, l ower the seeding rate to 
5 –10 lb/ac so as not to shade out companion grass or crop 
(Hancock Seed Co., 2014) . 
Management  
Crop residues from preceding cover crops can suppress 
browntop millet emergence (Amuri, 2008). Fertilization 
with  phosphorus  and  nitroge n can help increase forage 
productivity;  rate of application should  be determined by 
the results of soil tests and /or county extension 
recommenda tions. To control weeds, it is best to plant in a 
well -prepared, weed -free bed with narrow row spacing.  Chemical weed control options are limited (Baker, 1996).
 
It does not regrow well after cutting so is a one -cut crop.  
Pests and Potential Problems  
Browntop millet may  become infested with armyworms  
(MSU, 2010) , grasshoppers  (Baker , 1996) , and is 
susceptible to mung bean yellow mosaic bigeminivirus 
(Brunt et al., 1996) . 
 
Seeds and Plant Production  
Browntop millet is a short day (<12 hour) plant  that  will 
begin to set seed in 60 days (MSUES, 2010) . It can 
produce 140,000 s eeds/lb (Woodruff et al., 2 010) and 
1 ,500 lb of seed/ac (Warnell, 2014). Seed should be 
stored at 13% moisture or less (Oelke, 1990).
