and  Bromelica spectabilis (Scribn.) W. A. Weber  
Uses  
Purple oniongrass is usually found in scattered amounts 
so is not considered a major forage species.  However, it 
is ranked as providing  good to excellent forage for cattle 
  and horses and good for sheep and elk
.  Horses and cattle 
will utilize the plant during the entire growing season and 
are especially fond of the stalks and seed  heads but sheep 
usually do not graze the plant much until late fall  (Forest 
Service, 1937).  However, p urple oniongrass was found in 
the  summer  diets of sheep in a study in southwestern 
Montana (Buchanan et. al., 1972)  but amount s could not 
be quantified.  Deer and elk often graze it lightly (Forest 
Service, 1937).   Extensive use of the corms  (dense, 
underground vertical stems with dry papery leaf bases 
similar to a bulb)  by  grizzly bears in Yellowstone 
National Park have been  documented (Mealey, 1980).   
Restoration of disturbed areas using p urple oniongrass has 
been  done with limited success (Noller, 2001).

Please consult the PLANTS Web site and  your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status ( e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
Description  
General :  Grass Family (Poaceae).  Purple oniongrass is a 
native, perennial, loosely tufted, rhizomatous , cool season 
grass.  Culms are 45 -100 cm  (17 -39 in)  tall and the plant 
forms corms .  The corms are connected to the rhizomes 
by a root -like str ucture which usual ly remains attached to 
the corm.  Leaves are 2 -5 mm (0.08- 0.20 in) wide and 5 -
18 cm  (2 -7 in)  long.  Sheaths are usually glabrous and 
often pilose at the throat and collar.  Ligules are 1 -2mm 
(0.04- 0.08 in) long, acute, erose or lacerate and glabrous.  
The  panicle is 5- 26 cm (2-10 in) long, narrow to 
occasionally open and branches are 2 -5 cm (0.8 -2 in) 
long, usually appressed but sometimes divergent and 
flexuous with 2 -3 spikelets that disarticulate above the 
glumes.  Spikelets are 7 -19 mm  (0.28-0.75 in) lon g with 
3- 7 florets.  Glumes are usually less than half the length 
of the spikelets.  The spikelets have purplish colored 
bands that appear regularly spaced.  Lower glumes are 
3.5 -6.4 mm (0.14- 0.25 in) long, 1.5 -3 mm  (0.06-0.12 in) 
wide, and 1 -3 veined.  Up per glumes are 5 -7 mm  (0.20-
0.28 in) long, 2.3 -3.5 mm (0.09- 0.14 in) wide, and 5 -7 
veined.  Chromosome number is 2n = 18.  Purple 
oniongrass is often confused with Melica bulbosa 
(oniongrass) which has longer glumes and sessile corms.  
The purplish colored bands on spikelets of M. bulbosa 
also appear to be more concentrated towards the tips  
(Barkworth, 2007;  Perryman and Skinner, 2007)   
Distribution :  Purple oniongrass is found from Alberta 
and British Columbia in Canada south to Montana, 
Wyoming, and Colorado and westward to the Pacific 
Coast states of California, Washington, and Oregon.  For

current distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page 
for this species on the PLANTS Web site.

Habitat :  Purple oniongrass is found scattered througho ut 
foothill and lower elevation mountain shrub covered 
slopes and along forest margins from 3900- 8500 feet 
(1200- 2600 m) elevation and in  16-20+ inch  (406- 508+ 
mm)  annual precipitation zones.  
Adaptation  
Purple oniongrass is adapted to medium to fine textured, 
fertile soils  and grow in areas with moderate shade.   It 
grows in soils with a pH of 6.0 to 7.5 (USDA -NRCS, 
2012).  
Establishment  
I nformation in the  scientific literature on establishment of 
purple oniongrass  is very limited .  Link (1993) reports 
there are approximately 556,000 seeds per pound.   The 
seed matures in July/August and the seed needs cold 
stratification for 80 days at 32°F prior to planting.   The 
Upper Colorado Environmental Plant Center in Meeker, 
Colorado  has limited experience with g rowing the 
species.  They attempted to grow plants from seed  for 
Sequoia National Park  with poor results.  The plants did 
not  establish  well  and did not produce much seed (Parr,  personal communication
; Noller, 2001) ).  The closely 
related species M. bulbos a has also been documented as 
producing relatively small amounts of poorly germinating 
seed (Forest Service, 1937).  
Management  
Purple oniongrass appears to decrease when subjected to 
overgrazing by large animals (Skinner, 2010) .   
Pests and Potential Probl ems 
Purple oniongrass is susceptible to stripe smut fungus 
( Ustilago str iiformis ) but is not susceptible to flag smut 
fungus ( Urocystis agropyri ) (University of Illinois, 
Online).   It may be susceptible to other unknown pests or 
other problems.  
Environment al Concerns 
Purple oniongrass is a species native to the western 
United States and is not considered a weedy or invasive 
species.  Under ideal climatic conditions it might very 
slowly spread  into adjoin ing vegetative communities . 
Seed and Plant Production  
There is v ery little  published  information available 
regarding  seed or plant production  of purple oniongrass.  
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin)  
There are no improved, selected materials or cultivars of 
purple oniongrass.  The re may be unnamed selections or 
ecotypes of this species available from commercial 
sources.
