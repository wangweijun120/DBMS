Description
 
General :  Sensitive partridge pea is an annual , 
herbaceous , leguminous  plant. It  grows 4 –20 in (10– 50 
cm) tall on  multiple stems and has a well -developed 
taproot.  The hairless stems and branches have persistent 
4 –7 mm long lance -shaped, pointed bristles (stipules). 
The 3 –6 cm long oblong  leaves are alternatively arranged , 
sensitive to  move ment if you touch them , and have a 
small spine at the tip . The leaf may have 2 5 leaflets. The 
4 –9 mm long leaf petiole is covered with short, fine hairs, 
and has a single petiolar gland  located beneath the lowest 
pair of leaflets . It produces yellow flowers with irregular 
(zygomorphic) flower petals characteristic of the 
Caesalpinioideae subfamily of Leguminosae.  The 5 petals 
are all distinct, are approximately 1.5 cm wide, and  grow 
where the leaf and stem meet. The  stamens are separate, 
and the hairless  filaments are not united.  The oblong, 
elongate fruit is a single -cham bered legume that 
explosively  splits along one seam. Seeds are smooth and 
brown or black in color.  
  Distribution
:  Sensitive partridge pea is native to the 
U nited  States , Mexico, parts of South and Central 
America, and is  naturalized in the tropics and sub tropics 
of Asia (Cook et al., 2005). It grows along the East C oast 
from Maine to Florida, west to Arizona, and north to 
Wisconsin.  It is endangered in New Hampshire (Magee 
and Ahles, 1999). For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page fo r this species on the PLANTS 
Web site.  
 
Habitat :  Sensitive partridge pea can be found near rivers 
or ponds, in woods, prairies, thickets, and along 
roadsides.  It is common in disturbed sites in the eastern 
US  (Cook et al., 2005) . It is often found in the pine 
savannas and woodlands of the southern US. It will grow 
in association with native grasses such as little bluestem 
( Schizachyrium scoparium ) and  Indiangrass ( Sorgastrum 
nutans ); however once a  canopy develops sensitiv e 
partridge pea tends to die  out  (Leck and Leck, 2005) . 
 
Adaptation  
Sensitive partridge pea is classified as a USDA facultative 
upland plant that most often occurs in non -wetlands. It is 
a dapted to sandy soils  (Magee and Ahles, 1999).  It was 
found growing in association with little bluestem 
( Schizachyrium scoparium ),  devil’s -tongue prickly pear 
( Opuntia humifusa) , and white-haired panic grass 
( Dichanthelium villosissimum ) in the dry sand prairie 
habitat of Northern Illinois (Phillippe et al., 2008).  
 
Uses  
Forage/hay:  Generally  these species  are slow-growing, 
low -yielding , slow to decompose, and may have some 
toxicity, so are not always desired for grazing  (Allen and 
Allen,  1981) . However,  sensitive partridge pea has been 
used as forage or hay in infertile subtropical soils (Cook 
et al., 2005).  Its erect habit enables easy harvesting for 
cut -and -carry systems. Hay should be cut at first 
flowering to preserve its  nutritive quality. Sensitive 
partridge pea is also foraged by goats (Cook et al. , 2005). 
 
Cover crop:  The roots of sensitive part ridge pea are able 
to nodulate although its capability to nodulate is relatively 
low compared to the Mimosoideae ( Mimosa; Acacia ) and 
Faboideae  (soybean; pea; peanut; wild indigo) ( Naisbitt et 
al., 1992).  I t has branc hing nodulation with determinate 
nodule structure (Saur et al., 2000). In a  study comparing 
native legume species in a longleaf pine– wiregrass 
system, sensitive partridge pea had one of the greatest 
biomass results and highest overall tissue N c ontent of the 
nine species tested. This finding suggests that partridge 
pea can help build the N pool, soil organic matter, and 
increase N availability in some natural ecosystems. T he 
N
2 fixation activity was not different between shaded and 
non -shaded treatments  (Cathey et al., 2010) .

Wildlife:  Sensitive partridge pea is eaten by eastern 
mourning dove, eastern meadow lark, eastern turkey, and 
bobwhite (Graham, 1941). Sensitive partridge pea has 
extrafloral  nectaries that attract ants, spiders, and 
pollina tors. A study by Ruhren (2003) found that 
increasing partridge pea patch size leads to greater 
amounts of ants and parasitoid wasps while reducing the 
number of insect herbivores.  In another study by Ruhren 
and Handel (1999) the researchers found that sens itive 
partridge pea also attracted jumping spiders that helped 
increase fruit and seed production. Sensitive partridge pea 
has been used in pollinator habitat seed mixes in DOT 
roadside plantings.  It is the larval plant for the little 
sulphur and cloudless sulphur; and recommended for use 
in  monarch habitat  plantings (NCNPS, 2013).   
Ethnobotany  
The eastern band of Cherokee Indians used sensitive 
partridge pea in combination with  Cassia marilandica to 
treat spasms in infants (Cozzo, 20 04). 
Status  
Weedy or Invasive:   Because  partridge pea is a reseeding 
annual it may spread to nearby fields, especially where 
competition is removed.   
 
Please consult with your local NRCS Field Office, 
Cooperative Ext ension Service office, state natural 
resource, or state agriculture department regarding its 
status and use . Please consult the PLANTS Web site 
( http://plants.usda.gov/
)  and your State Department of 
Natural Resources for this plant’s current status (e.g., 
threatened or endangered species, state noxious status, 
and wetland indicator values).
 
Planting Guidelines  
Plant scarified s eeds in late spring –early summer  in a 
well -prepared seedbed in full sun. The seed does not 
require ino culation, and will use native rhizobia already 
present in soil  (Cook et al., 2005).  Plant approximately 10 
lb/ac  at ¼  – ¾ in ches deep.  It may be planted in a seed 
mix for hay or forage, but its ability to reestablish itse lf 
from seed will be limited by com petition. Stronger stands 
can be produ ced through reseeding each year. The 
USDA -NRCS recommends planting 1.5 lb/ac seed or 6% 
of  a native wildflower mix to attract monarch butterflies 
( USDA -NRCS, 2015a ). 
 
Management  
Over time, stands of sensitive partridge  pea will become 
invaded by grasses and weeds. These grasses can be 
mowed off, and the f ields lightly disked in fall to clear  
residue, open up the soil, and incorporate  fall-produced 
seed.  
 
Seeds and Plant Production  
Sensitive partridge pea is a reseeding annual that flowers 
from July –September (Cook et al., 2005).  The seeds 
require scarification for good germination. Sensitive  partridge pea had a maximum germination rate under wet 
heat (boiling water) at 70
–80°C (Boli n, 2009). Seedlings 
are fast growing and may bloom within 6 weeks (Cook et 
al., 2005). It is a C
3  species that can show strong 
responses to elevated atmospheric CO
2  levels by 
responding negatively with lower rates of branching, 
height, and leaf formation ( Millhollen et al., 2006; 
Matiella, 2009). It can produce 5 –30 lb/ac/yr biomass in 
longleaf pine/wiregrass/bluestem plant communities 
(USDA -NRCS, 2015b). There are approximately 455 
seeds/g (Cook et al., 2005)
