Description  
General :  Sesame  (Sesamum orientale ) is an introduced 
annual  broadleaf plant that grows 5 –6 ft (155- 185 cm) 
tall. It prod uces a  1 –2 in  ( 2.5 –5 cm ) long  white, bell -
shaped  inflorescence growing from the leaf axil s (where 
the leaf stalk joins the stem).  The blooms do not open all 
at once, but gradually, from the base of the stem upwards 
to the top of the plant. The flowers are both  male and 
female  and will self -pollinate . The seed is produced in a 
1 –1.5  in ( 2.5–3.8 cm ) long, divided  seed capsule that  
opens when the seeds are mature.  There are 8 rows of 
seed within each seed capsule, and seed may be ye llow, 
white, brown , or black (Morris, 2002) . Due to the non -
uniform, indeterminate nature of the bloom period, the 
reproductive, ripening, and drying phases of the seed tend 
to overlap. Seed lowest on the plant will mature first, even 
as the upper part of the plant is still flowering or has just 
formed seed capsules.  
 
Sesame varieties have single  or multiple stems.  The stem 
is covered with short, soft hairs. Se same is very leafy; with
 3 –5 in  ( 7.5 –12.7 cm ) long , somewhat rough,  lance -
shaped, entire upper leaves,  and tri -lobed lower leaves.   
 
Sesame  has been grown in many parts of the world for 
over 4000 years. First introduced in the southern United  
States by slaves, the plant’s potential as an oil seed was 
quickly recogni zed and enthusiastically promoted by 
Thomas Jefferson. Currently, the United States imports 
more sesame  than it grows, so there is potential for 
increasing production acres  in the US , especially as more 
shatter -resistant varieties are developed.   
Distribution :  Sesame  is most commonly planted in the 
south and southwestern United States , but  is also being 
promoted in the southeast because it grows well in hot 
weather and sandy soils. For current distribution, please 
consult the Plant Profile page for this  species on the 
PLANTS Web site.  
Habitat :  Sesame grows best in  well -drained, sandy loam 
soils, with a pH  from 5 –8. Sesame cannot survive 
standing water or high salinity environments.  
Adaptation  
Sesame is n otable for its ability to grow under droughty 
conditions and in  extreme heat. It is often grown where 
cotton can grow , under conditions few other crops can 
survive,  requiring very few inputs. These attributes make 
sesame an excellent candidate for low -input sustainable 
food systems.  Sesame is  deep -rooted and will scavenge 
nutrients from below most crop root zones (Langham et 
al., 2008). W hen grown from East Texas to the Atlantic 
coast sesame becomes more susceptible to leaf diseases 
(Langham et al., 2008) . Sesame has moderate salt 
tolerance  (Bahrami and Razmjoo, 2012) , but will not 
grow under flooded conditions. Generally, the plant will 
have a better chance of survival when it is  grown in hotter 
than optimal temperatures rather than lower than optimal 
temperatures (Langham et al., 2008).  
Uses  
Forage /Feed: 
Sesame seed meal is high in protein and can be used  to 
feed livestock and chi ckens. In aquaculture systems, 
s esame oil cakes  have similar protein content to soybean 
meal and  are successfully  used as a fishmeal protein 
sub stitute without negatively affecting the growth of 
carnivorous fish (Thu et al., 2011) . Two separate studies, 
one with rainbow trout (Thu et al., 2011) and another with 
great sturge ons (Jahanbakhshi et al., 2012) , found that 
almost half of these fishes’ di et of fishmeal could be 
substituted with sesame oil cake.

Cover crop/green manure:  
Sesame is a vigorous  summer annual that can be grown as 
a cover crop to improve soil structure (Myers, 2002) . 
Sesame can increase yields in subsequent cash crops by 
suc cessfully improving soil moisture retention and soil 
tilth (Langham et al., 2008). Sesame, similar to sunn 
hemp and sorghum -sudangras s, can successfully reduce 
root -knot nematode populations  in subsequent crops 
(Sipes and Arakaki, 1997; McSorley, 1999; Ro driguez-
Kabana et al., 1988 ). Sesame has a higher C:N ratio than 
most legume covers, vigorously outcompetes weeds, and 
may attract beneficial insects (Creamer and Baldwin, 
2000).  Cotton intercropped with sesame has been shown 
to regulate cotton bollworm/corn earworm ( Pimbert, 
2003).  Sesame has also  been used extensively i n hybrid 
poplar agroforestry systems in China  (Gold and Hanover, 
1987) . 
 
Phytoremediation:   
Sesame  plants have  be en used  to successfully accumulate 
and remove from the soils the  broad-spectrum  
organochlorine pesticide lindane, a neurotoxin  that can 
persist in soils for many years  (Abhilash and Singh, 
2010) . 
 
Wildlife:  
Sesame seed is eaten by songbirds, quail, and doves.  
Ethnobotany  
Sesame seed has a long history of use for its oil as well as 
other food products such as bread and bakery items. 
Approximately 70% of  worldwide seed production  is 
processed into oil and meal (Morris, 2002).  The seed has 
excellent nutritional value (Bahrami  and Razmjoo, 2012), 
is  high  in fat and protein content , and is valued as a 
cooking oil because it has higher levels of antioxidants 
than other cooking oils (Myers, 2002) . Japan  considers 
sesame a health food and leads the world in imports 
(Morris, 2002) . The seed can be eaten raw or roas ted. 
White sesame seed from Mexico, Guatemala, and El 
Salvador is consumed at rates twice that of black sesame 
seed from China and Thailand (Morris, 2002).   
Status  
T his  plant may become weedy or invasive in some 
regions or habitats and may displace desirable vegetation 
if not properly managed.    
Please consult the PLANTS Web site 
( http://plants.usda.gov/
)  and your State Department of 
Natural Resources for this plant’s current status (e.g., 
threatened or endangered species, state noxious status, 
and wetland indicator values).  
Planting Guidelines 
It is important to provide adequate moisture during 
planting for  successful stand establishment.  Seed requires 
soil temperatures of at least 70˚F (Myers, 2002) for 
germination, but any s oil crusting can significantly reduce 
seedling emergence. Planting into pre- irrigated or moist soils can improve germination and seedli
ng growth. Seed 
s hould be planted  at 2 –3 lb/ac at ¾ –1½  in  deep in late 
spring/early summer, when soils are sufficiently warm.  I t 
grows slow ly in the seed ling stage so may require 
cultivation for weed control.  If weeds are going to be 
cultivated, 18  to  30-inch  rows should be planted.  
 
Both  row planters and seed  drills can be used to establish 
stands. No -till planting may  increase soil surface  moisture 
at time of planting, but  sesame is a small seed, and may 
not achieve good soil to seed contact.  Generally , row 
spacing is determined by farmer preference for weed 
cultivation and whether or not irrigation is available. 
Wider row spacing is recommended for weed cultivation 
and when planting in drier fields with less irrigation 
(Langham et al., 2008).   
 
Since  sesame is a low input crop, u sing a leguminous 
cover crop or animal manure prior to establishment can 
provide enough nitrogen for  following  sesame crop  
(Myers, 2002). If fertilized, the last application of 
fertilizer should be applied no later than the pre -
reproductive stage ( just after first green buds emerge). If 
soil  amendment s are used, their use should be based on 
recommendations provided by soil testing laboratories 
and/or cooperative extension.  The last irrigation should be 
no later than the late bloo m stage. 
Management  
Sesame can be planted as a  primary crop or a secondary 
crop after wheat (Langham et al., 2008).  Generally, 
sesame is a low -input crop, requiring no herbicide use, so 
production costs tend to be less than soybean or sorghum  
(Myers, 2002). Weed control is typically achieved 
through inter -row cultivation and irrigation requirements 
are minimal. Sesame  is a drought -tolerant  crop that only 
requires one  heavy irrigation prior to establishment,  with 
fast and light irrigation after  establishment when needed 
(Langham et al., 2008) . 
 
A pproximately 120– 150 days after planting (DAP)  
(Langham et al., 2008) or b y October, sesame will have 
dropped its leaves and dried for seed  harvesting. If part of 
the sesame stem remains green, th e plant can be further 
dried by  cut ting  and  raking  into windrows before 
combining.  Seed should be below 6% moisture at 
harvesting (Langham et al., 2008).  Harvesting should be 
done  before frost to avoid seed damage (Myers, 2002). A 
row crop header like the o ne used for soybean may be 
used  with a reduced air and cylinder speed.  
Pests and Potential Problems  
Pest threats or potential damage are minimal. Under cool, 
wet conditions, soil pathogens can kill seedlings (Myers, 
2002 ). Windy conditions can cause lodg ing. 
Control  
Please contact your local agricultural extension specialist 
or county weed specialist to learn what works best in your

area and how to use it safely.  Always read label and 
safety instructions for each control method.   
Seeds and Plant Production 
Sesame is an indeterminate plant with overlapping phases 
of development. Sesame requires 125 –135 days to mature 
in  the Midwest (Myers, 2002). Flowering starts 
approximately 35– 45 DAP  (Langham et al., 2008). It will 
drop most of its leaves during the ripening phases. Total 
biomass yield is 800– 1000 lb/acre (Myers, 2002).  Most 
sesame grown around  the world is harvested manually. 
There are appr oximately 70 seeds per capsule. Seed color 
varies and may be white (h igher market price), yellow, or 
dark brown.   
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin)   
Some specialty growers will sell selected materials in 
small amounts. One plant breeder in the southern US has 
developed several varieties of  non-dehiscent (ND) seed 
by traditional breeding. These varieties can be harvested 
with mechanical equipment from dried standing plants. 
There has been successful development of sesame 
cultivars with some resistance to high salt concentrations 
( Bahrami and Raz mjoo, 2012). 
 
Cultivars should be selected based on the local climate, 
resistance to local pests, and intended use. Consult with 
your local land grant university, local extension or local 
USDA NRCS office for recommendations on adapted 
cultivars for use in  your area.
