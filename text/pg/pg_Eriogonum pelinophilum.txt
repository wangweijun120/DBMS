Uses  
Clay -loving wild buckwheat , (Eriogonum 
pelinophilum ) was  first collected in 1958 near 
Hotchkiss, Colorado, in De lta County by Howard 
Gentry ( U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  ( USFWS,  
1988 ).  The species w as first described by James 
Reveal in 1973.  Clay -loving wild buckwheat ’s 
particularly long  flowering period extends from May 
to early September with individual flowers lasting 
fewer than 3 days.  Perhaps due to its extended 
flowering period or because it is the most abundant 
species in bloom in its habitat, clay -loving wild 
buckwheat  f lowers are  visited by more than 50 
species of pollinators in a season  (Bowlin et al. , 
1992) .  Roughly half of these 50 species are native 
bees, and 18 species are native ants  ( US FWS,  2009) .  
US FWS in its 5 -year review of th e species cited 
Tepedino  (2011)  noting  that of all Eriogonum  species 
studied to date, none has as many pollinators as clay -
loving wild buckwheat . 
  Edible buckwheat (
Fagopyrum esculentum ) is an 
important food crop originating from Eurasia and is 
in the same botanical family  as clay -loving wild 
buckwheat .  Although the common name alludes to 
it,  clay -loving wild buckwheat has  no association 
with wheat or cereal grains.   There are no  
agricultural, economic, or other human uses of clay -
loving wild buckwheat known at this time.  
 
Status 
Clay -loving wild buckwheat  was  designated as 
endangered ,  with critical habitat,  by the USFWS  in 
1984.  In 2009 , t he USFWS completed  a 5 -year status 
review  to update the status of  the species .  This 
review noted that the range of clay -loving wild 
buckwheat primarily stayed the same as when the 
recovery plan was completed in 1988 (USFWS , 
2009 ) (some sites were destroyed while new sites 
were discovered ) even though increases in species 
numbers  were noted  ( from 10,000 known individuals 
to ~278,425 kno wn individuals).  The USFWS 
attributed the se changes  in population to  increased 
survey effort s rather than species expansion 
(USFWS,  2009) .  The Nature Serve conservation 
status rank  an  international effort which rank species 
on their “global” status, denot es clay -loving wild 
buckwheat  as G2/S2 - globally imperiled and 
statewide imperiled,  with a high risk of extinction 
due to very restricted range, very few populations 
(often 20 or fewer), steep declines, or other factors  
(NatureServe, 2011) . 
Description  
General :   
Buckwheat  family ( Polygonaceae).  C lay-loving wild 
buckwheat  is a long -lived  low-growing,  spreading 
sub -shrub, reaching up to 4 inches (10 centimeters ) in 
height and 12  in (30 cm) across ( Reveal, 2005).  
“Stems are spread ing without persistent leaf bases up 
to 1/3
 the height of the plant; aerial flowering stems 
spreading to erect, slender,  l eaves, 1 per node” 
( Reveal , 2005).   Leaves are dark green and appear 
needle- like with in -rolled margins  (US FWS,  2009).  
Flowers  are white  to cream  with reddish -brown 
midribs  and brownish -red bases ( USFWS, 2009) , 
( Figure 2 ), petals all the same length .  Fruits are 
achenes, light brown,  0 .1 in ( 0.3 to 0 .35 cm)  and 
triangular in cross -section . Flowering  occurs  late  
May to early September .

Clay-lovi ng wild buckwheat may be disting uished 
from its close relative s E. clavellatum  and  E. 
contortum , according to Rev eal (2005) and 
Spackman et al. (1997)  as  follows:    
 
E. clavellatum   is larger in stature and habit an d  has 
larger  flowers up to 1.8 in (4.5 c m) with  petals of two 
different  lengths, E . clavellatum  lacks the reddish-
brown midribs and brownish -red bases  and  E. 
clavellatum  is known to occur  only in the Four 
Corners region (Weber , 1987).  Attempts to separate 
the two genetically have been  inconclusive. 
 
E. contortum  has yellow flowers and occurs farther 
north than E. pelinophilum , in Mesa and Garfield 
Counties in Colorado and in Grand County, Utah, 
(Spackman et al. ,1997).  
 
Distribution :   
Clay -loving wild buckwheat is e ndemic to the rolling 
clay (adobe) hills and flats immediately adjacent to 
the communities of Delta and Montrose, of west -
central  Colorado.  According to US FWS 5-year 
review (2009) ,  citing  information based  on spatial 
data tracked by the Colorado Natural Heritage  
Program in 2009,  the  total global population  of this 
species occur s roughly within an area that is 11.5 mi 
north to south and 28.5 mi east to west.  N early 75% 
of the existing known populations and habitat for 
clay -loving buckwheat occur on private land  
( USFWS 2009) . Please consult the USFWS website 
at  www.fws.gov  for a map of the species occurrence.   
 
For current distribution, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site.   
 
Habitat :  
The habitat of clay -loving wild buckwheat consists of 
a dobe clay badland hills and flats  within the sparse ly 
vegetated  desert shrub community.  Th is plant 
community  includes the following clay -loving 
buckwheat  plant  associates:   mat saltbush ( Atriplex  corrugata),
 black sagebrush ( Artemesia nova), 
shadscale ( Atriplex confertifolia ), Gardner’s saltbush, 
( Atriplex gardneri ), bud sagebrush ( Picrothamnus 
desertorum ), charming woodyaster, ( Xylorhiza 
venusta),  and Adobe Hills beardtongue ( Penstemon 
retrorsus ) (US FWS,  2009) , (Rocky Mountain 
Herbarium , 2010) .   
 
Adaptation   
Clay -loving wild  buckwheat is adapted to the harsh 
growing conditions that include clay, alkaline, and 
calcareous soils of the Mancos shale formation , 
unique to west -central Colorado  (Potter , 1985) .  The 
Mancos shale formation has been associated with 
high salts and selenium  (USFWS , 2009) , however  no 
selenium accumulation information related to  clay -
loving wild buckwheat is known at this time.   At 
elevations  ranging from 5,180 to 6,350  ft., clay -
loving wild buckwheat is generally found growing on 
the mid  to lower slopes of the  rolling topography of 
the a dobe Mancos shale hills, also occurring in 
swales or drainages  ( US FWS,  2009) .   With an 
average annual total  precipitation of 7-10  inches , 
clay -loving wild buckwheat is dependent upon the 
microclimates created by the small ar eas where snow 
lingers longer due to aspect , topography, and 
landscape  position.

Management 
Clay -loving wild buckwheat is a long -lived species , 
as demonstrated by static populations over the last 20 
years , with recruitment of seedling plants being 
sporadic and infrequent  (US FWS , 2009).  Clay -
loving wild buckwheat occurrences and suitable 
habitat  continue to be  threatened by growing 
development  pr essure  and related  expansion  activities 
around the communities where it occurs .  
Additionally, 75% of the occupied  habitat occurs on 
private lands .  In Colorado,  endangered plant species 
are not afforded protection unless a Federal nexus  
exists , such as  canal development projects.  
Conservation efforts geared toward private lands 
would greatly benefit this species to prevent further 
isolation of the small existing populations most at

risk from habitat fragmentation, thereby reducing the 
resiliency of the se populations.   
 
Pests and Potential Problems  
Tent caterpillar impacts were noted on clay -loving 
buckwheat by Ferguson (2007).   
Environmental Concerns  
The effects of climate change  could pose continued 
uncertainty to the long  term survival of clay-loving  
wild buckwheat  populations .  Due to the limited 
range of the  Mancos shale  formation and the long -
lived nature of this species, its ability to migrate with 
changing climates is uncertain .  Decreased or lack of 
flowering has been noted in association with t he 1998 
drought in the region, thereby causing concern that a 
lack of precipitation , during t he growing and 
flowering season, could significantly impact seedling 
recruitment ( USFWS,  2009).    
Seeds and Plant Production  
Clay -loving wild buckwheat  requires an insect 
pollinator in order to set seed , for both outcrossing 
and self -pollination  (within a plant but not within a 
flower)  ( Bowlin et al. 1993, Tepedino et al. , 2011).   
O’Kane in 1985  stated that “s eed dispersal is usually 
passive, either bein g consumed or carried by animals, 
windblown , or moved by gravity or water.”   “All  
E riogonum  species studied thus far have seeds that 
require a cold period to break dormancy (not 
necessarily a freeze), and some E riogonum species 
have seeds with a 5 -year shelf life (Reveal undated, 
cit. in O'Kane 1985). ” 
 
According to the  Colorado Natural Areas Program  
life history study of clay -loving wild buckwheat, it 
appears that this species grows at highest densities 
away from  other shrubs, such as black sagebrush 
(Art emisia nova)  (CNAP , 1987) .  Other research  in 
which  individuals  of clay -loving wild buckwheat  
were  permanently  tagged from 1990  to 2008  support s 
the conclusion that this species is relatively long -
lived (20 -30years  minimum) , (Lyon, 2008) .
