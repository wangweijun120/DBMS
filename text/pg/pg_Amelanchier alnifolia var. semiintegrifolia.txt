Alternate Names 
Pacific serviceberry has been referred to in the 
literature by several different scientific names, 
including Amelanchier florida , Amelanchier 
alnifolia , and currently, as a variety of  Amelanchier 
alnifolia  (Saskatoon serviceberry).  The infomation 
contained in this document refers specifically to 
Pacific serviceberry (as a variety of  Amelanchier 
alnifolia ) only when so stated.  Synonyms of Pacific 
serviceberry include  Amelanchier alnifolia  spp. 
florida  and Amelanchier florida  (USDA Natural 
Resources Conservation Service 1999). 
 
 
Uses 
Cultural : Amelanchier alnifolia  has a long history of 
use by native populations and early settlers of the 
Pacific Northwest.  The berries were eaten raw or 
cooked or dried and stored.  Dried berries were often 
mixed with dried vegetables or meat or cooked in 
soups or puddings.  Cakes of dried berries were a 
common trading item (Gunther 1995; Turner and 
others 1990).  The wood is hard and was used for 
combs, digging sticks, firedrills, arrows, tool handles, 
hoops, and spreaders.  De coction of stems, twigs 
(bark), leaves, and berries were used as medicine 
(Turner and others 1990). 
 
Ornamentals : Pacific serviceberry may be used 
effectively in naturalized plantings and as hedges, 
windbreaks, or screens in urban areas (Flessner and 
others 1992).  Several cultivars of saskatoon 
serviceberry are available  for ornamental plantings 
and commercial fr uit production in North America.  
Many of these cultivars and ecotypes originated in 
western Canada and the northern region of the United 
States.  The named varieties have larger, sweeter, and 
juicier fruits than their wild relatives and are used to 
make jams, jellies, syrups, baked goods, candies, fruit 
leather, and wine.  Commercial producers in Alberta, 
Sasketchewan, and Manitoba have established many 
acres of saskatoons and have developed a fresh and 
processed fruit cottage industry (Wilson 1993). 
 
Wildlife:  Deer, moose, and other mammals browse 
serviceberry, and its fruit is relished by several 
species of song and game birds (Elias 1980; Marks 
and Marks 1988).  These shrubs are often used as 
cover for small mammals and birds.

Streambank and Riparian Restoration : Pacific 
serviceberry is an excellent candidate for streambank 
and riparian restoration in terms of erosion control 
and improved wildlife habitat as the species suckers 
readily and tolerates many types of soils (Dirr 1983; 
L.H. Bailey Hortorium 1976; Plummer and others 
1968). 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status (e.g. threat ened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values).

Description 
General: This cool season species is a thicket-
forming shrub or small tree 3-12 meters tall with 
smooth brown bark, slender branches, and oblong 
leaves sharply and coarsely toothed along the upper 
margin (Elias 1980).  For  Amelanchier alnifolia, a 
typical ramet is comprised of long shoots and short 
shoots; only short shoots bear fruit.  Floral buds are 
formed in the first season  on branches at least one-
year-old, and fruit develops the following season (St. 
Pierre and Steeves 1990).  Clusters of perfect white 
flowers appear in spring  before leaves, and dark 
purple to black berrylike pomes are produced in mid- 
or late summer (USDA Forest Service 1974).  It is 
primarily self pollinated but may be cross-pollinated 
via insects or wind (D avidson and Mazza 1991; 
Olson 1984).  Recent  studies show basic 
chromosome number is n=17; there are diploid 
(2n=34) as well as tetraploid plants (4n=68) (Pruski 
and others 1991).  The fruit contains 4-10 dark brown 
seeds with leathery seed  coats (USDA Forest Service 
1974).  This species may not flower and reproduce 
before 10 years or longer, especially on harsh sites 
(Wasser and Shoemaker 1982). 
 
Distribution : For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site.  Pacific serviceberry occurs west 
of the Cascade and Sierra Nevada Mountain ranges, 
from British Columbia south to central California 
(USDA Forest Service 1974). 
 
Habitat: The plant may be found in open woods, 
along canyons, or on hillsides, from near sea level to 
subalpine altitudes (Anonymous 1976).  Pacific 
serviceberry is reported as a component of  Quercus 
garryana, prairie, mixed conifer, and  Pseudotsuga 
menziesii/Pinus contora/Berberis nervosa/Spirea 
betulifolia  plant communities  (Franklin and Dryness 
1973). 
 
Adaptation 
The species is tolerant of most soil textures and 
occurs from near sea level to subalpine altitudes 
(Wasser and Shoemaker 1982).  It is found on open, 
dry rocky slopes to partially shaded sites with moist, 
deep soils but prefers mois t, well-drained, acid soil 
and full sun or partial sh ade (Dirr 1983; Wasser and 
Shoemaker 1982; Wilson 1993).   Amelanchier 
alnifolia  was reported to increase in frequency 
following fire, although canopy cover decreased, in 
one study (Anderson and Bailey 1980).  Plants of 
Amelanchier alnifolia  can even be grown in granitic 
mine spoil and produce reasonable growth, but not on 
pyritic spoil (Voeller and others 1998).  This species  is generally not tolerant of saline soils and high water 
tables (Wasser and Shoemaker 1982). 
 
Establishment 
Amelanchier alnifolia
 reproduces naturally by stolons 
and seed.  In nursery practice, cultivars may be 
propagated successfully by cold-moist stratification 
of dried seed, division, layering, root cuttings, 
grafting or budding, and tissue culture (Anonymous 
1976b; Dirr 1983; Dirr and Heuser 1987; McDonald 
1986; Nelson and Bishop 1980; USDA Forest 
Service 1974). 
 
Seeding:  Seed propagation can result in variability in 
select traits of 20-30% (Pruski and others 1991).  
Many growers use open-pollinated seedlings from 
named cultivars of saskatoon serviceberry for 
commercial orchard establishm ent as this species is 
difficult to vegetatively propagate by conventional 
means (Davidson and Mazza 1 991).  This method of 
establishment should be monitored and evaluated for 
variability, depending on targeted use of fruit.  
 
It is important to note that usually a large percentage 
of seed collected from wild populations is infertile 
and insect-infested.  Seed can be extracted from 
berries using a dull-bladed or rubber-bladed blender 
(Kabaluk and St. Pierre 1992).  Once seed is 
separated from pulp and skin , they may be placed in a 
mixture of 1:1:1 peat-perlite-vermiculite and 
stratified (moist-chilled) at 4 °C for 3-6 months 
(Kabaluk and St. Pierre 1992; USDA Forest Service 
1974).  Acid scarification (abrasion of seed coat) may 
reduce stratification length, although the acid 
concentration and duration of  scarification must first 
be tested or evaluated for  effectiveness.  Prior to 
stratification, selecting medium-weight seeds may 
further reduce seed dormancy (Weber and others 
1982).  Some propagators have encountered severe 
fungal growth during cold  stratification; using sterile 
conditions and adding fungicide to the media can 
reduce the fungal growth (McTavish 1986).  Average 
germination percentages of cold-moist stratified seed 
range from 50 to 70%. 
 
Once fresh seed is separated from the pulp and air-
dried, the dry seed may be further cleaned using hand 
screens, a fanning mill, or air-screen machine (USDA 
Forest Service 1974; Wasser and Shoemaker 1982).  
Although seed quality for  Amelanchier alnifolia has 
not been standardized, a minimum of 95% purity and 
60% germination is desired (Wasser and Shoemaker 
1982), and seeds per pound can range from 36,000 to 
113,000  
or a mean of 61,000 (Vories 1980).  Air-dried seed of 
serviceberry may be stored in sealed containers with

little decline in viability for 5 years (USDA Forest 
Service 1974).  Many seeds do not germinate until 
the second spring. 
 
In the nursery, the saskatoon serviceberry is seeded at 
the rate of 25 pure live seeds per foot of row (Wasser 
and Shoemaker 1982).  This seeding rate may be 
reduced to obtain desired or original composition on 
sites being restored or improved.  Unstratified seed is 
planted in late fall, and  moist, pre-chilled seed is 
planted in spring, at a depth of approximately 0.6 
centimeters (USDA Forest Service 1974; Wasser and 
Shoemaker 1982). 
 
Cuttings: Reports of rooting success using softwood 
cuttings of  Amelanchier alnifolia  are variable 
(Bishop and Nelson 1980; Dirr 1983; Harris 1976; 
Pruski and others 1991).  Timing of cutting and stage 
of growth of the mother  shrub are important factors 
in rooting success (Bishop and Nelson 1980).  Best 
results (95% rooting) were obtained using softwood 
cuttings taken from etiolated, field-grown, 
rejuvenated stock plants under intermittent mist 
without hormonal treatment (Nelson 1987).  Summer 
rooted cuttings cease growth following rooting and 
exhibit poor winter surv ival (Harris 1976).  
Hormonal treatments in combination with other 
factors have been used to prevent this dormancy 
(Pruski and others 1991).  Another study reported 
80% rooting using 4-5 inch softwood cuttings from 
terminal stems with a basal dusting in talc of 0.8% 
IBA and placed in 100% perlite in a mist bench 
(Chong and others 1992).  Bottom heat (70 °F or 
21
oC) has been reported to improve rooting success 
in some cases (Bishop and Nelson 1980; Harris 
1976). 
 
Transplants or containerized stock should be planted 
in early spring (for harsh, cold sites) or fall  (Wasser 
and Shoemaker 1982).  Planting material should be 
between 15 cm and 60 cm in height with extensive 
fibrous root systems for best  results (Wilson 1993).  
Moist soil, mulch, and partial shade enhance survival 
and growth (Wasser and Shoemaker 1982).  Bare-
root stock may be planted in early spring.  Two-year-
old seedlings may be lifted in fall and stored at 33 ° F 
(1 ° C) until planting (Howe 1976).  For fruit 
production, seedlings may be planted in rows; 
between row and within row spacing should be a 
minimum of 3.6 meters and 1.8 meters, respectively 
(Flessner and others 1992). 
 
Management  
Fruit Production:  For commercial orchards and 
ornamental specimens, branches that are more than 
four years old may be pruned out in spring for better  fruit production and longer life span (Wallace 1978).  
Pruning of established stands may also include 1) 
removal of low spreading branches to encourage air 
circulation and more upright form, 2) removal of 
diseased shoots, and 3) heading back shoots to six 
feet for more efficient harvest.  Saskatoons usually 
begin to bear fruit when 3 to 5 years old, with full 
production at 8 years (Wilson 1993).  Average crop 
yields of orchards range from 3000 to 4000 pounds 
per acre, with some orchards producing as much as 
6000 pounds per acre (Wilson 1993).  Well-
maintained orchards can 
produce fruit for 20 years 
(Harris 1976). 
 
Soil tests are necessary to determine fertilization 
requirements.  Application of a balanced fertilizer 
during establishment will maximize survival and 
growth (Wilson 1993).  Y early fertilization with 100 
pounds per acre of ammonium nitrate will improve 
color, size, and quality of fruit in older stands (Harris 
1976).  Weed control (chemical and mechanical) and 
irrigation also enhance fruit production (Harris 1976).  
The water requirements of saskatoon orchards are 
about 45 centimeters per year.  Maintaining soil 
moisture at 50% of its water holding capacity is 
optimum for growth (Wilson 1993). 
 
Revegetation :  For streambank or riparian restoration, 
Pacific serviceberry (two-year-old stock) should be 
planted on the upper bank.  Weed control and 
irrigation during the first growing season will 
enhance survival and growth.  Moderate browsing of 
Amelanchier alnifolia  can increase twig production 
(Wasser and Shoemaker 1982).   Spring burns on 
high elevation rangeland can cause mortality but also 
significantly increase twig production in  Amelanchier 
alnifolia  (Cook and others 1994).  Saskatoon 
serviceberry occurs in forests with fire regimes 
varying from frequent, low-severity fire to 
infrequent, severe fire (Howard 1997; Hickerson 
1986). 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
This species is susceptible to several pathogens 
including those that cause rust, witches broom, fire 
blight, powdery mildew, leaf blights or spots, fruit 
rot, dieback, canker, root rot, and wound rot.  It is 
also host to several insects including leaf miners, 
borers, mites, sawflies, scale, root aphids, tent 
caterpillars, tarnished plant bug, and apple curculio 
( Tachypterrellus quadrigibbus ) (Anonymous 1976; 
Dirr 1983; Furniss and Carolin 1977; Furniss and 
Krebill 1972; Pruski and others 1991; Steeves and 
others 1979; USDA Forest Service1971).  Of these 
pests, rust, fire blight, and leaf blights cause the 
greatest losses; the apple curculio greatly reduces

fruit yields (Furniss and Krebill 1972; Steeves and 
others 1979; USDA Forest Service 1971).  Preventive 
measures including pruning out diseased wood and 
maintaining an open canopy aid in disease control.  
Biological measures (B.T.) and pesticides may be 
used to control pests. 
 
Amelanchier alnifolia  is capable of producing toxic 
levels of hydrogen cyanid e (prussic acid) (Majak and 
others 1980a; Majak and others 1978).  This is toxic 
to ruminants such as deer and cattle, although 
prunasin concentration in new growth (leaves) varies 
with subspecies or variety (Brooke and others 1988; 
Majak and others 1980b; Quinton and others 1985).  
Higher levels of this toxin are present in leaves and 
twigs during bloom stage and rapidly decline 
thereafter (Majak and others 1981).  Reports of 
mycorrhizae on  Amelanchier species are lacking. 
 
Pacific serviceberry is not  considered to be weedy or 
invasive, but individuals with concerns for a 
particular environment should make their decisions 
concerning plant selection and use on a case-by-case 
basis.  It is recommended that local or on-site sources 
of Pacific serviceberry are used for restoration or 
revegetation projects. 
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and 
area of origin) 
Currently, no cultivars of Pacific serviceberry have 
been developed.  The development of saskatoon 
serviceberry [Amelanchier alnifolia (Nutt.) Nutt. ex 
M. Roemer] cultivars has been slow, occurring over 
many years (Davidson and Mazza 1991).  The most 
important of these cultivars have been selected from 
wild populations, although some hybridization has 
resulted in commercially acceptable varieties 
(Davidson and Mazza 1991 ; Wilson 1993).  
Improved fruit quality and a better growth habit have 
been the result.  Notable cultivars and improved 
materials include ‘Altaglow’ (Alberta), ‘Smoky’ 
(Alberta), ‘Pembina’ (Alberta), ‘Forestberg’ 
(Alberta), ‘Northline’ (Alberta), ‘Thiessen’ 
(Saskatchewan), ‘Honeywood’ (Saskatchewan), and 
‘Regent’ (MN).
