Alternate Names  
Common Alternate Names:  golden pea, yellow pea, 
buffalo pea , mountain  false lupine  
 
Scientific Alternate Names:  T.  rhombifolia  var. montana 
(Nutt.) Isely  
Uses  
Wildlife/L ivestock: 
Wildlife and livestock typically avoid mountain 
goldenbanner.  Although reports of palatability vary, it  is often considered unpalatable and is left in the stand after 
all other forage has been consumed (Hermann 1966).
 
 
Restoration:  
This species is recommended for use in non -grazed areas. 
It is used for soil and slope stabilization on roadside 
plantings in Idaho (Robson and Kingery 2006).  
 
Native Plant Gardens : 
Mountain goldenbanner is a valuable species for native 
plant gardens and p ollinator plantings. The species is 
noted for its ease to grow and bright flowers which persist 
for several weeks. The flowers are especially attractive to 
bumblebees.  
 
Ethnobotanical:  
The Ramah Navajo used a d ecoction of the plant as cough 
medicine  and cr eated a  fumigant  of mountain 
goldenbanner  for headaches (V estal  1952) . 
Status  
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status ( e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, a nd wetland indicator values).  
Weediness  
This plant may become weedy or invasive in some 
regions or habitats and may displace desirable vegetation 
if not properly managed.  Please consult with your local 
NRCS Field Office, Cooperative Extension Service 
offi ce, state natural resource, or state agriculture 
department regarding its status and use.  Weed 
information is also available from the PLANTS Web site

Sites on the Plant Profile for this species for further 
information.  
Description  
General :  Legume family (Fabaceae) . Mountain 
goldenbanner is a perennial rhizomatous forb from 20 to 
75 cm ( 29 in) tall with erect  branching stems. The leaves 
are palmately trifoliate (3 leaflets) arising from a 1 to 4 
cm ( 0.4 to 1.6 in) long petiole. At the base of the petiole is 
a pair of leaf -like stipules, 1 to 3 cm ( 0.4 to 1.2 in) long. 
The leaflets are 2 to 9 cm ( 0.8 to 3.5 in) long and 0.5 to 
3 .6 cm ( 0.2 to 1.4 in) wide, elliptic to lanceolate or 
oblanceolate and acute to rounded on the tip. The flowers 
are born in a 6 to 25 cm ( 2.4 to 9.8 in) long raceme or 
loose spike, with 2 to 23 yellow flowers. Each flower is 
20 to 26 mm ( 0.08 to 0.1 in) lo ng and resembles a pea or 
lupine flower. The fruit is a 4  to 5 .5 cm (1.6 to 2.2  in) 
long pod which dries to a blac kish color (Welsh et al. 
2003).  The p ods of mountain goldenbanner  are erect. The

seeds are brown and kidney shaped. There are 
approximately 30,600 seeds per pound (Barner 2009). 
Distribution :    
Mountain goldenbanner occurs in m ost western states 
from New Mexico north to Montana and  west to Oregon 
and Washington. It is not known to occur in California. 
For current distribution, please consult the  Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.  
 
Habitat :   
This species is m ost often found in moist sites in 
meadows or along streams seeps and springs (Welsh et al. 
2003) at elevations of  760 to 3,500 m ( 2,500 to 11,400 ft ) 
(Robson and Kingery 2006; Welsh et al. 2003 ). 
Adaptation  
Mountain goldenbanner is adapted to moist, well -drained 
sandy to loam soils  with a pH of 6.6 to 8.5.  The plants 
will persist in areas within USDA  hardiness zones 4a to 
9b  (Dave’s Garden, online) .  
Establishment  
When used for pollinator plantings or native plant 
gardens, golden mountain banner can be established by 
seed or with greenhouse propagated plants. This species 
spreads via rhizomes and should be planted where a 
colony is desired.  The full stand seeding ra te for mountain 
goldenbanner is 35 lbs/acre. Adjust this amount to the 
percentage of the seed mixture desired.  Seed should be 
planted to a depth of 1/4 to 1/2 inch in late fall to allow 
for natural stratification.  
Management  
Due to its low palatability, mo untain goldenbanner 
i ncreases  on overgrazed range (USDA 1937) . This species 
is not recommended for planting on range or pasture 
where grazing occurs.  
Pests and Potential Problems  
Mountain goldenbanner can be considered weedy on 
roadsides, pastures and ran gelands. It is not palatable to 
livestock and may compete  with more desirable 
vegetation .  
 
Mountain goldenbanner is known to be toxic. It contains 
alkaloids which are especially toxic in young plants and 
in mature flowering plants  (Burrows and Tyrl 2001) . All 
parts of the plant are toxic. Ingesting 0.6 to 2.8g of dry 
foliage per kg of body weight for several days produces 
severe muscle degeneration in cattle (Keeler et al 1986). 
Chase and Keeler (1983) indicate that ingesting  300 to 
400g of dried plant ma terial for 3 to 4 days will severely 
intoxicate cattle and slightly more can be lethal.   
 
Humans can also be affected  by consuming mountain 
goldenbanner. Children suffered digestive tract problems, 
weakness and neurological effects after eating a few seeds  
or flowers (Spoerke et al. 1988) .   
Environmental Concerns
 
Mountain goldenbanner  is native to western North 
America and poses  no known environmental concerns.  
 
Control  
Mountain golden banner  can be controlled in range and 
hay land using broadleaf herbicide s, specifically 2,4-D, 
Dicamba, Picloram, Triclopyr, or combinations  thereof 
( Plumlee 2004).  
 
Please contact your local agricultural extension specialist 
or county weed specialist to learn what works best in your 
area and how to use it safely.  Always read  label and 
safety instructions for each control method.  Trade names 
and control measures appear in this document only to 
provide specific information.  USDA NRCS does not 
guarantee or warranty the products and control methods 
named, and other products may  be equally effective.  
Seeds and Plant Production  
Seed is mature in July and August when pods begin to 
split open. Seed is large and easily cleaned with screens 
or an air column. Barner (2009) recommends processing 
the seed using a brush machine with a #20  mantel 
followed by air -screening size 10 top screen and a 1/20 
bottom screen . 
 
Germination is improved with scarification. Skinner 
(2005) reported 93% germination from seed scarified in 
hot water at 180° F compared to 39% germination from 
untreated seed. Seed that had been mechanically scarified 
with sandpaper or scratched with a needle had 56 and 
84% germination respectively (Skinner 2005).  
 
For optimum growth, goldenbanner seed should be 
inoculated with the proper Rhizobium species prior to 
planting.  
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin)  
Seed of  mountain goldenbanner is  available in limited 
quantities on the commercial market. Larger quantities of 
seed can be grown on a contract basis.
