Wildlife  
Established plants of fernleaf biscuitroot, like other 
members of the  Lomatium genus, begins growth very 
early in the spring, often just following snow melt, 
providing crucial early forage for many wildlife and 
domestic animals. It is considered a very valuable 
forage species due to its large stature and high 
biomass production level s. Ogle and Brazee (2009) 
rate members of the genus as desirable spring and 
summer forage for cattle, sheep, horses, elk, deer and 
antelope.  
 
Early green -up and flowering make this an important 
species for early spring pollinators and other insects. 
It is highly attractive to some bees. Pollinator surveys 
at native stands of f ernleaf biscuitroot showed 
frequent  visitation  by  several species of Andrena  and 
Micrandrena  that are oligolectic (pollen specialists)  
for this genus . In cultivated stands, honeybees and 
overwintering queens of Halictus  and  Lasioglossum  
bee species are sometimes frequent.

Fernleaf biscuitroot has been identified as an 
important plant species in sage -grouse habitat. Pre -
laying sage -grouse hens eat the foliage (Barnett and 
Crawford, 1994). Sage -grouse chicks consume the 
plants, as well as associated insects (Drut et al., 
1994 ). 
 
Ethnobotanic  
Fernleaf bisc uitroot, known as Toza by the Numic 
speaking tribes of the Great Basin, was commonly 
used for food, medicine, and ceremonial purposes 
(Meilleur et al., 1990). It is one of the most widely 
used plant species in native North American culture 
(Moerman, 1998).

The root is a larg e, sometimes branching, taproot 
reaching approximately 30 cm (1 ft) long and 5 cm (2 
in) thick.

*NOTE: Fernleaf biscuit root foliage bears a strong 
resemblance to poison hem lock (Conium 
maculatum ). The two can be distinguished 
vegetatively by the small purple spots found on 
hemlock stems and petioles. Hemlock also has white 
flowers instead of yellow or purple.  
 
Distribution : 
Fernleaf biscuitroot naturally occurs from British 
Columbia and Saskatchewan south to California and 
New Mexico and extends eastward to Wyoming and 
Colorado.  For current distribution in North America, 
consult the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS website.  
 
Habitat :  
This species is common i n mountain and Wyoming 
big  sagebrush, pinyon -juniper, and mountain shrub 
communities  from 150 to 3,000 m (500 to 10, 000 ft) throughout
 its range  (Welsh et al., 2003; Hickman, 
1993) .  
 
Adaptation  
Fernleaf biscuitroot  is adapted to coarse-  to fine -
textured soils with pH of 6.5 to 7.5. It can be found in 
a variety of plant communities in areas receiving 360 
to 760 mm (14 to 30 in) or more mean annual 
precipitation (USDA -NRCS, 2010).   
 
Establishment  
Seed can be broadcast or drilled to 0.3 to 0.6 cm (1/8 
to 1/4 in) into a well prepared, weed -free seedbed. 
This species should be seeded in late fall as a 
dormant planting to allow for natural stratification of 
the seed over winter.  
 
Management  
Once estab lished, fernleaf biscuitroot is very 
competitive against weeds due to its long taproot; 
however additional measures to control weeds are 
necessary for seed production.  
 
Pests and Potential Problems  
Thompson (1998) conducted plant pest surveys at a 
natural  stand of fernleaf biscuitroot near Pullman, 
Washington over a 10 year period. He found that the 
greatest threat to fernleaf biscuitroot was pocket 
gophers, which accounted for 43% of the plant 
mortality observed in his study. Plants were grazed 
by rabbits  and deer. They were also attacked by leaf 
miners, gall causing flies and Puccinia  rust. 
Additionally, fernleaf biscuitroot can be a host to ant-
tended aphids, and the seeds are consumed by 
Smicronyx  seed weevils (Cane, unpubl.).  
Colonization by the basidiomycete fungus 
Rhizoctonia solani  has been observed following wet 
spring  conditions (Tisserat, unpubl.).  
 
Environmental Concerns  
There are no known environmental concerns 
regarding fernleaf biscuitroot.  
 
Seed  and Plant Production  
Small scale production  
See d matures in July into August. Wildland seed 
disarticulates readily and is easily hand collected. 
Very clean collections can be made by shaking 
ripened inflorescences over a bag or tarp. Minor 
screening to remove sticks provides excellent purity.   
 
Extende d seed stratification is required for successful 
propagation of fernleaf biscuitroot. At the time of 
dispersal, the seeds have underdeveloped embryos 
which require a trigger for growth prior to 
germination. Scholten et al. (2009) observed that 
greatest emb ryo elongation occurred at temperatures 
of 3.4 to 5.5째 C (38 to 42째 F). The best germination 
percentages occurred at 3.4 C (38째 F) with 
approximately 16 weeks of cold/moist stratification.

Baskin and Baskin (2002) recommend a cold moist 
stratification for 330 days followed by 18째 C 
germination conditions. In Pullman, Washington, 
best results were obtained when seed was sown into 
containers in the fall that were left outside to 
overwinter. Germination begins in March and growth 
continues for 3 to 4 months until the plants go 
dormant in late July or August. Containerized plants 
should be left outside in a lath house for an additional 
winter before transplanting the following spring. 
Flowering and seed production typically begins 3 
years after transplanting (Skinner, 2004).  
 
Large scale production  
Seed can be drilled in rows at  82 to 98 PLS/m (25- 30 
PLS/ft ) or into weed barrier fabric at 45 to 60 cm (18 
to 24 in) spacing. Dormant fall seedings are 
recommended to permit over -winter stratification.

Above ground growth is slow as young plants invest 
significant resources to produce a substantial taproot. 
Plants grow in early spring into summer and go 
dormant in mid -s ummer, giving the appearance of 
mortality. During the first year of establishment, most 
plants will only produce a few leaves. Seed 
production fields at Aberdeen, Idaho did not produce 
flowers or seed until the fourth year of production. 
Similarly, organic  herb growers report 4 year old 
plants which are still not ready for harvest, but it was 
not indicated if these plants were from seed or 
transplants (Lomatium.com, 2010). Experimental 
plots at Ontario, Oregon, using supplemental 
irrigation produced seed in  the fourth season with 
peak yields of 482 kg/ha (430 lb/ac) ( Shock et al. 
2010).

Good weed control can be achieved through the use 
of weed barrier fabric and hand roguing . Because 
fernleaf biscuitroot enters dormancy in early summer, 
foliar herbicide applications of glyphosate to 
surrounding weeds are possible after senescence.   
 
Always read and follow label and safety instructions 
for each control method.  USDA -NRCS does not 
guarantee or warranty any products or control 
methods named, and other products may be equally 
effective.  
 
New techniques are being investigated regarding the 
feasibility of growing fernleaf biscuitroot densely in 
rooting beds prior to field establishm ent. This method 
would allow a grower to sacrifice a much smaller 
area in the first 1 to 2 years of plant development 
while the plants are not producing seed. Trials 
indicate that taproots transplanted in autumn establish 
well (Jensen, 2010).  
 
Shock et al.  ( 2010) at Ontario, Oregon showed a 
significant positive response to irrigation with 10 and 
20 cm (4 and 8 in) additional water. Ontario has a 
mean annual precipitation of 24 cm (9.5 in) (U.S. 
Climate Data, 2010), bringing the total received 
water to appro ximately 46 cm (18 in) for optimum 
seed production.  
 
Though fernleaf biscuitroot flowers are self -fertile, 
they still require visitation by pollinators for 
fertilization to occur. Cane (2007) showed a 60X

increase in seed set in the presence of pollinators . 
Fernleaf biscuitroot has  a very restricted range of 
natural pollinators; primarily the oligolectic Andrena 
and  Micrandrena  spp., thus developing a manageable 
pollinator for seed production is unlikely. In 
cultivation, honey bees and sweat bees may suffice, 
but a planting trial is recommended.  
 
Seed can be harvested in production fields via a 
vacuum type harvester or flail vac (Bair and Tilley, 
2010). Seed can be cleaned using an air screen 
cleaner. Purities approximating 100% are achievable 
with minimal e ffort. 
 
Cultivars, Improved and Selected Materials (and 
area of origin)  
Common wildland collected seed is available from 
commercial sources. There are currently no 
commercial releases of fernleaf biscuitroot. 
Commercial growers are producing pooled Source

Range).
