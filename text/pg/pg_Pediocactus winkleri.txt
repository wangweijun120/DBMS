Uses  
There are no known human or wildlife uses for 
Winkler’s pincushion cactus. Plants are collected 
illegally by cactus  enthusiasts.  
Status  
Win kler’s pincushion cactus was listed as a 
threatened  species  by the USDI Fish and Wildlife 
Service in 1998 ( USDI-FWS, 1998 ). Monitoring data 
indicate that populations are in decline (USDI -FWS, 
2007).

Description  
General : Cactus  family ( Cactus). Winkler’s 
pincushion cactus is a solitary or sometimes colonial, 
spherical or depressed -hemisp heric cactus growing 4 
to 7 cm ( 1.6 to 2.8 in) tall and 3 to 5 cm ( 1.2 to 2.0 
in) wide. The tubercles are 4 to 7 mm ( 0.16 to 0.28 
in) long and 5 to 7 mm ( 0.20 to 0.28 in) wide. The     
areoles are white-
wooly with no central spin e. There 
are 8 to 14 white radial spines, 1.5 to 4 mm (0.06 to 
0.16 in) long. The flowers are peach to pink with 
petals and sepals looking similar. The fruit is a 
smooth green oval -shaped berry drying reddish 
brown, 7 to 10 mm (0.28 to 0.39 in) long and 8 to 11 
mm ( 0.31 to 0.43 in) wide. The seeds are 2.5 to 3 mm 
( 0.10 to 0.12 in) long and shiny black (Welsh et al., 
2003).  
 
In  1995, Hochstatter proposed that Winkler’s 
pincushion cactus and San Rafael cactus ( P. 
despainii ) be considered subspecies of Brady’s 
pincushion cactus ( P. bradyi), a federally listed  
species from northern Arizona . However; Heil and 
Porter (2004) showed  through DNA analysis that  P. 
winkleri  and P. despainii were  more closely allied to, 
but distinct species  from mountain ball cact us (P. 
simpsonii ). 
 
Distribution : 
There are four known populations of Winkler’s 
pincushion cactus located in  north central Wayne 
County, Utah on the eastern boundary of Capitol 
Reef National Park to extreme southwest Emery 
County, Utah. There are approximately 4,500 
documented individuals of Winkler’s pincushion 
cactus in known populations and an additional 20,000 
individuals estimated in unsurveyed available habitat 
( USDI -FWS, 2007) . The majority of Winkler’s 
pincushion cactus habitat is located o n Federal lands 
managed by USDI -BLM and USDI -NPS.  
 
For current distribution, consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.  
 
Habitat :  
Winkler’s pincushion cactus occurs in the  galleta -
three awn shrub steppe and salt desert shrub p lant 
communities  in association with saltbush ( Atriplex 
spp.) galleta ( Hilaria sp.) and purple three awn 
( Aristida purpurea)  (USDI-FWS, 2007).  
 
Adaptation  
This species is adapted to poor quality, saline, fine -
textured substrates of the Dakota, Mancos and 
M orrison Formations from 1,460 to 1,590 m ( 4,790 
to 5,220 ft) (Welsh et al., 2003). Average annual 
precipitation for the area is 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in) 
(USDI -FWS, 2007).
