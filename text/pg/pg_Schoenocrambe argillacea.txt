Uses  
There  are no known human or wildlife uses of clay 
reed -mustard . 
 
  Status 
Clay reed
-mustard was listed as a threatened species 
in 1992 based on its small population size, restricted 
distribution and existing threats (USDI -FWS, 1992) . 
 
Recently, Al -Shehbaz , and subsequently, the Flora of 
North  America,  combined  much of Schoenocrambe 
into the larger genus Hesperidanthus  (Al -Shehbaz, 
2005) . This change has not yet been adopted by the 
PLANTS database or USDI Fish and Wildlife 
Service.

Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s

state noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
Description  
General : Mustard  family ( Brassicaceae).  Clay reed -
mustard is a perennial forb with 13 to 30 cm (5 to 12 
in) tall simple or branched stems, arising from a 
branching woody caudex and stout taproot. The 
linear  leaves are somewhat thickened and glaucus, 9 
to 35 mm (0.35 to 1.4 in) long and 1  to 2 mm (0.04 to 
0.08  in) wide. The inflorescence is a 5 to 22 flowered 
raceme. The flowers sit on 7 to 18 mm ( 0.3 to 0.7 in) 
long pedicels; the white or pink petals are 8 to 11 mm 
( 0.3 to 0.4 in) long and are suffused with conspicuous 
purple veins. The fruit is a silique (a lengthened pod), 
18  to 55 mm (0.7 to 2.2 in) long and approximately 1 
mm ( 0.04 in) wide (Welsh et al., 2003).  
 
Distribution : 
There are three known populations of clay reed -
mustard, all located in Uintah County, Utah. The 
entire species range stretches approximately 21 km 
(13  mi) from Green River to Willow Creek. There  are 
approximately 6,000 plants  total  (USDI -FWS, 1994).  
 
For current distribution, consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.  
 
Habitat :  
Clay reed -mustard occurs in desert shrub plant 
communities in association with shadscale ( Atriplex 
confertifolia ), Indian ricegrass ( Achnatherum 
hymenoides ), pygmy sagebrush ( Artemisia pygmaea), 
western wheatgrass ( Pascopyrum smithii), Salina 
wildrye ( Elymus salina ), and jointfir ( Ephedra spp.) 
(USDI -FWS, 1994; Welsh et al., 2003).

Adaptation 
Clay reed -mustard grows on gypsiferous clay soils 
overlain with sandstone talus resulting from a 
mixture from the zone of contact between the Uinta 
and Green River formations (USDI -FWS, 1994).  
This species occurs in a narrow band  from 1,465 to 
1,720  m ( 4,800 to 5,640  ft) in a 15 to 23 cm (6 to 9 
in) precipitation zone (WRCC, 2011).  
 
Management  
Existing threats to clay reed -mustard  include oil and 
gas exploration, oil- shale mining, stone quarrying, 
and off -road vehicle (ORV) use. All known 
populations are found on Federal lands leased for oil 
and gas energy reserves. Additionally, this species ’ 
range is underlain by oil shale, which may be mined 
when  economic  conditions  for oil extraction  becomes 
favorable (USDI -FWS, 1994).  
 
Management goals for clay reed -mustard include 
inventorying  suitable habitat, conducting population 
studies,  and controlling  activities affecting the 
sensitive  habitat. 
 
Pests and Potential Problems  
Historical sheep and cattle grazing  use may have 
impacted  clay reed-mustard  on US DI-BLM lands. 
However current grazing levels are not believed to 
pose a serious threat  (USDI -FWS, 1994).  
  
Environmental Concerns  
There are no kno wn environmental concerns 
associated with  clay reed-mustard . 
 
 
Seed and Plant Production  
Flowering occurs from April to May with fruit 
ripening in May to June  (USDI -FWS, 1994) . No 
propagation information is currently available.
