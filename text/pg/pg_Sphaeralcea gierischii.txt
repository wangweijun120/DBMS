Uses  
There are no known human  uses of Gierisch 
globe mallow . It is palatable to livestock and wildlife , 
especially in drought years when other forage s are 
reduced or unavailable  (USDI -FWS, 2010).  
Status   Gierisch 
globemallow  became a candidate for federal 
protection in 2008 (USID -FWS, 2008).  Listing is 
considered warranted; however, higher priority   
 
listing actions have precluded the proposed and final 
listing rules for the species (USDI -FWS, 2010).  The 
species has a listing priority of 2 (high magnitude 
with imminent threat).

General : Mallow  family ( Malvaceae).  Gierisch 
globemallow  is a perennial forb growing from a 
woody caudex, with the inflorescence reaching 40 to 
100 cm ( 16 to 39 in) tall.  The stems are often dark 
reddish purple. The leaves are 3 to 5 lobed, bright 
green, and oval shaped in outline. The leaf base is 
often heart shaped. The blades are 1.2 to 4 cm ( 0.5 to 
1.6  in) long and 1 to 5 cm ( 0.4 to 2.0 in) wide. The 
flowers  are large  with orange petals, 15 to 25 mm 
( 0.6 to 1.0 in) long (Welsh et al., 2003).  
 
Distribution : 
Gierisch  globemallow  is known from nine 
populations totaling approximately 60 acres. Eight 
populations are located in northern Mohave County, 
Arizona, and one population i s in Washington 
County, Utah. There are between 7,000 and 12,000 
individuals in Arizona, and the Utah population is 
believed to be approximately  5,000 to 8,000

Habitat :  
Gierisch  globemallow  is found in warm desert shrub 
plant communities of the northern Mohave Desert at 
approximately 1,090 m (3,576 ft) (Welsh et al., 
2003).  
 
Adaptation  
Gierisch  globemallow  is an obligate gypsophile ( a 
plant  limited to gypsum based soils ) restricted to 
outcrops of the Harrisburg Member  of the Kaibab 
Formation.  The area receives approximately 13 to 20 
cm  (5 to 8  in) of annual precipitation (WRCC, 2011).
