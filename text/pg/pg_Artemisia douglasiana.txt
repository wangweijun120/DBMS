Description  
General :  Douglas’ sagewort is an aromatic perennial forb in the 
sunflower family (Asteraceae) that is native to the western United 
States. It is rhizomatous and has many slender, 3 -5 ft . tall stems. 
The leaf blades are 3 -6 in . long, and can be as wide as 2 in .  across. 
In color, they are green to grey- green, silvery-white underneath, In 
shape, they are narrowly elliptic to widely oblanceolate with 3 -5 
lateral lobes (Shultz, 2006,2014) . The upper-surface is sparsely 
hairy, while the lower surface is densely hairy. The grey flowering 
heads are leafy -bracted panicles with short matted hairs. The 
disciform heads are 0.1  – 0.2  in. diameter, inconspicuous in 
clusters,  with pistilate flowers (5 -9) and disk flowers (6 -25). 
Bloom is from mid -spring through late fall. The fruits 0.05  x 
0.1in. ) are grey brown.  
 
Distribution :  Douglas’ sagewort is  native to western North America from Washington and Idaho, through Oregon, in 
Nevada, through California and the Baja Peninsular of Mexico. It is found along the Pacific coast and in riparian corridors 
from sea level to 7,200 feet in elevation (USDA). For current distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page for this 
species o n the PLANTS Web site.  
 
Habitat :  Douglas’ sagewort is found primarily in drainages and riparian corridors (Shultz 2006).  It grows well in dry or 
moist shaded sites and is tolerant or a range of soil types. It may be found in meadows at higher elevations.  
Adaptation  
Douglas’ sagewort grows on a variety of soil types in riparian habitats . It dies back over the wint er and also with summer 
drought,  the rhizomes spout with  moisture and warmer temperatures in the spring.   
Uses    
Wildlife:  Ecological benefits of Douglas’ sagewort to wildlife include seed forage, perching spots, and vegetative cover for 
birds, as well as nesting material for bees once the plant has senesced.  
 
Warning  
Douglas’ sagewort extracts have been shown to be cytotoxic to human cells (Giordano et al., 1990). Pregnant women 
should not ingest mugwort, as it is an abortifacient. Douglas’ sagewort contains the monoterpene thujone, a 
neurotoxin which in high doses causes convulsions, seizures, and even death. Because thujone is extracted by alcohols, 
it is strongly advised not to make mugwort tinctures (Somaweera at al. 2013). Aqueous solutions of thujone are in 
minute concentrations and so are probably safe for use (A dams and Garcia, 2006).

Ethnobotany 
Medicinal :  Douglas’ sagewort is highly esteemed by many  
California tribes for its many medicinal applications. The Miwok 
use the leaves to prepare a tea that is sipped to reduce swelling in 
any part of the body, and  use it to relive prostate problems.  
(McCarthy et al 2012). Leaves are rubbed on the forehead to 
relieve headaches  (Personal observation and Train et al, 1957) . It 
is  commonly used as a remedy for poison oak rash (Duncan , 1961; 
McCarthy et al., 2012;  Timbrook, 1990; 2007).  In Argentina, the 
chewed leaves are used to treat peptic ulcers and external sores and 
s tudies have been conducted on other medicinal uses ( Giordano et 
al., 1990).  
 
Reports in the literature from the Costanoans,  Pomo, and Maidu 
document  its use as an analgesic to treat colds, fevers, and 
respiratory problems such as bronchitis and asthma (Bocek , 1982; 
Chestnut , 1902: Duncan, 1961 ); and for headaches and earaches 
( Barrett and Gifford,  1933; Bocek , 1982).  Douglas’ sagewort  was  
also  used  as a compress for wounds, to treat sores and peptic ulcers 
( Heinrich et al., 1998 , Timbrook, 2007) and urinary problems 
(Bocek , 1982).  It was used  regularly  for women’s  health issues, 
such as treating  premenstrual syndrome and dysmenorrhea 
(Adams and Garcia, 2006), to improve circulation after childbirth 
(Chestnut, 1902) and to terminate difficult pregnancies 
(Somaweera et al ., 2013). Tongva girls bathed in tea in preparation 
for puberty (Incayawar,  2010).   
 
Ceremonial : Douglas’ sagewort (mugwort) is revered by 
indigenous tribes in California. It is  used during ceremonies and 
for  other purposes, such as to ward off spirits and ghosts, 
especially after the death of a family member and for repatriation 
ceremonies (Duncan, 1961; MacCarthy, 2012).  It is often placed in several locations in the home for pr otection (McCarthy et 
al., 2012).  The Paiute people used Douglas’ sagewort  ceremoniously as a wash when coming out of ritual dances ( Reid et al., 
2009 ).  Mourning Miwok would plug their nostrils with its leaves, using the aroma to clear their heads  (Barrett and Gifford,  
1933).   
 
Other uses:   Douglas’ sagewort has insect repellant properties. L eaves were placed in baskets and food storage containers to 
keep pests away. ( Reid et al., 2009.). A Chumash myth indicates that leaves were used to line babies cradles (Timbrook, 
2007). Leaves would be burned to stave off mosquitos (Bocek, 1982; Duncan, 1961). The Costanoans burned its branches to 
smoke bees from nests (Bocek, 1982 ). 
Status  
T his  plant may become weedy or invasive in some regions or habitats and may displace desirable vegetation if not properly 
managed.  It is not considered a weed in natural areas, but can occasionally become weedy in such areas as drainage ditches 
and low places in pastures (DiTomaso and Healy, (2007).   
Please consult the PLANTS Web site ( http://plants.usda.gov/
) and your  state ’s Department of Natural Resources for this 
plant’s current status (e.g., thre atened or endangered species, state noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
Planting Guidelines 
Douglas’ sagewort  seeds germinate at relatively cool temperatures  to coincide with fall precipitation . D irect seeding can be 
done throughout the late  fall and winter on prepared sites  at a seeding rate of 2.2 lb/acre drilled at a depth of ¼ inch, or 3 
lb/acre broadcast . At Elkhorn Slough on the central California Coast f ield plantings were generally most successful in the 
early spring ( ESNERR, 2001).  If seeding must be done later  in the spring, stratification may be of benefit (Deitschman , 
1974).   Establishment fro m transplants  is also successful as o ne- and 2 -year -old seedlings can  be field-planted early in the 
spring, as  fall transplanting is  generally  not successful  (Deitschman 1974).  Irrigation will assist with establishment for the 
first year or two depending upon the location. It  would be essential for drier sites.   Douglas’ sagewort can also  be effectively 
propagated from rhizomes, using a protocol  developed for Artemisia vulgaris , which showed that ~75% of 2-cm long 
rhizome sections produced roots and shoots (Klingeman et al. 2004). Once established, Douglas’ sagewort spreads easily 
from rhizomes  and b ecause of this, a few established plants can ef fectively populate a suitable site.

Control 
Please contact your local agricultural extension specialist or county weed specialist to learn what works best in your area and 
how to use it safely.  Always read label and safety instructions for each control m ethod.  Trade names and control measures 
appear in this document only to provide specific information.  USDA NRCS does not guarantee or warranty the products and 
control methods named, and other products may be equally effective.  
Seeds and Plant Production  
Collection and storage:  D etermination of fruit ripeness can be  difficult because of the small fruit  size . Douglas’ sagewort is  
ready to harvest  when fruits can be easily removed  from the heads by shaking and are  too hard to be easily crushed with a 
thumbnail. Because the fruit  matures so late in the season, it often has to be harvested  quickly after maturity to avoid losses 
and storm damage . The heads are clipped, placed in paper bags to dry, then rubbed over screens to remove the chaff and 
stored in  a dry cooler ( ESNERR, 2001).  For propagation, fruits are sown into plug trays filled with potting mix then lightly 
covered with more potting mix. The trays are misted with an automatic irrigation system. Fifteen days after germination, 
seedlings are trans planted into larger containers, then moved into a lath house, keeping them moist. Transplant survival 
averages 85%  and one or two year old plants can be used for planting out  (Young 2001).   
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area of origin)   
Cultivars should be selected based on the local climate, resistance to local pests, and intended use. Consult with your local  
land grant university, local extension or local USDA NRCS office for recommendations on adapted cultivars for use in your 
area.
