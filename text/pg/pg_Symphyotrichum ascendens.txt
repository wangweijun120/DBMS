Uses  
Reclamation  
Western aster is a forb species  that may have potential  for 
rangeland seedings in semi arid plant communities. It 
establishes readily from broadcast or drill seedings and 
competes  with and even suppresses cheatgrass ( Bromus tectorum
) (Stevens and Monsen 2004). Western aster 
recovers well from wildfires and spreads naturally by seed 
and rhizomes (Stevens and Monsen 2004). It does not 
require significant soil preparation for establishment and 
can  be used on shallow,  rocky and infertile soils including 
roadways  (Stevens and Monsen 2004).  
 
Erosion control  
Western aster can be used for  seeding unstable slopes . 
Young  plants do not attract heavy use  from cattle, and the 
mature plants provide good cover and ha ve extensive 
roots ( Stevens and Mons en 1994).  
 
Wildlife/range  
In most instances western aster is a valuable forage 
species for large animals and livestock (Stevens and 
Monsen 2004). The plants  green up early  in spring and 
stay green through fall and into winter.  Englemann aster 
( Eucephalus engelmannii ) is believed to be mor e 
palatable than western aster;  however  Stevens and 
Monsen  (2004) note  that western aster receives moderate 
to heavy seasonal grazing. Its root system of dense 
rhizomes makes  it resistant to tr ampling and grazing.  
Western aster can accumulate selenium on contaminated 
soils and become toxic to livestock.  
 
Pollinators  
Western aster is a valuable species for attracting native 
pollinators. It is visited by native bees and butterflies 
( Lady Bird John son Wildflower  Center  2012).   
Status  
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plantâ€™s current 
status ( e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
Description  
General :  Composite family (Asteraceae).  Western aster 
is a rhizomatous perennial forb with flowering stems 
reaching 12 to 105 cm ( 5 to 42 in) tall. The leaves are 1 to 
16 cm ( 0.4 to 6 in) long and 2 to 15 mm ( 0.08 to 0.6 in) 
wide becoming smaller upwards . The leaves are mostly 
entire  with ciliate margins. The inflorescence is an open 
cluster of numerous flower heads . Each flower head bears 
15 to 40 purplish to violet (rarely white) r ay flowers 5 to 
15 mm ( 0.2 to 0.6 in) long surrounding a series of yellow 
disk flowers (Cronquist et al. 1994).  The fruit is a 
pubescent  brown, cylindrical  to obovoid  achene, 2 to 3.5 
mm ( 0.08 to 0.14 in) long bearing a 4 to 7 mm ( 0.16 to 
0.28  in) long pappus of capillary bristles (SEINet 2012).

Distribution:    
Western aster occurs throughout western North America 
from British Columbia south to California and east to 
New Mexico, Nebraska and Saskatchewan. For current 
distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page for this 
species on t he PLANTS Web site.  
 
Habitat :   
Western aster can be found growing in a wide range of 
habitats  from 850 to 3,200 m ( 2,790 to 10,500 ft) (Welsh 
et al. 2003) . It is common in arid areas in sagebrush , 
rabbitbrush  and pinyon juniper communities . It is 
frequent ly found in wetter sites at low elevations 
including hanging gardens and riparian areas in 
cottonwood and willow communities. At higher 
elevations it is found in mountain brush, aspen and 
spruce -fir communities (Welsh et al. 2003).  
Adaptation  
Western aster  is adapted to a broad range of conditions. It 
is found in arid to mesic condition s on sites receiving 200 
to 1067  mm (8 to42  in) mean annual precipitation. 
Western aster grows  in loamy soils with a pH  of 5.0 to 
8.0.  It is recommended for use in USDA Plant  Hardiness 
Zones 3 to 9 (Wilson 2012) . 
Establishment  
Western aster can be established via direct seeding or by 
sprigging with rhizomes. Western aster is typically 
broadcast seeded, but drill seeding is also effective. Seed 
should be drilled to a depth of  no more than 6 mm ( 0.25 
in ) ( Stevens and Monsen 2004).  To facilitate seed flow 
through seeding equipment, seed should be better than 
50% purity ( Stevens and Monsen 2004). Western aster 
seed decreases in viability under storage conditions. 
Stevens and Mons en (2004) recommend the use of  seed 
le ss than 3 years old . 
 
Western aster s eedlings develop an  extensive root system 
during the first growing season.  It is not typically 
damaged by grazing, rabbits or rodents during the  first 
year ( Stevens and Monsen 2004 ). 
Management  
Western aster  should be  used as a minor component of 
seed mixtures.  Management strategies should be based 
on the key species in the established plant community.  
Grazing should be deferred on seeded lands for at least 
two growing seasons to allow for full stand establishment 
(O gle et al.  2011; Stevens and Monsen 2004). Once 
established,  western aster is  relatively competitive agains t 
weeds  including cheatgrass (Stevens and Monsen 2004) . 
 
Pests and Potential Problems  
Western aster is known to absorb selenium in selenium 
rich soils causing it to become toxic to cattle and sheep 
(Davis et al. 2011; Davis et al. 2012).  
  Environmental Concerns
 
Western aster  is native to western North America and 
poses  no known environmental concerns.  
Seed and Plant Production  
Seed  is collected  from August to November. The 
inflorescence  and seed are brown when mature (Young  
2001 ). Flowers of western aster mature i ndeterminately, 
and  there may be large amounts  of immature seeds in a 
lot.  Most seed sold has approximately 10 to 14% purity 
with the pappus in tact. The pappus can be removed using 
brush machine or light hammer milling (Stevens and 
Monsen 2004). Seed should be purchased and utilized 
using PLS rates. There are approximately 2.5 million 
seeds per pound ( Stevens and Monsen 2004).  
 
Western aster seed  does not require a pretreatment or chill 
period for germination  (Young 2001). Viable seed 
g erminates in 15 to 20 days ( Stevens and Monsen 2004; 
Young  2001).  
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin)  
Seed of western aster is availabl e in limited quantities on 
the commercial market. Larger quantities of seed can be 
grown on a contract basis (Walker and Shaw 2005).
