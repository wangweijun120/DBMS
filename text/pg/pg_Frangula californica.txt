Description  
General : Coffeeberry is a perennial evergreen  or semi-deciduous  shrub in the buckthorn family ( Rhamnaceae) native to the 
western United States. It grows 6  –  10  ft. tall, under some conditions,  it  can  grow as large as 15 ft. tall. The bark  is  bright  
grey- brown,  and new growth on twigs  is often reddish . Alternately arranged leaves range  from ¾ – 4 in . long and are elliptic 
to ovate in shape . The inflorescence consists o f many small, clustered, yellow -gre en flowers  each with 5 petals . It bears 2 -
stoned fruits that turn from green through red to black and are about ½ in ches in  diameter (Sawyer , 2012, 2016).  The  current 
sub species are described below but the complex needs further study using modern techniqu es (Sawyer, 2016). 
F. californica ssp. californica , the  common  coffeeberry has l eaves ¾ – 3 in ches , narrowly to widely elliptic with an acute tip, 
dark green, lighter underneath. Flowers bloom in  May and June 
( Calflora, 1997; Sawyer, 2012, 2016) .   
 
F. californica ssp. crassifolia . The s ubspecies  is  similar to ssp. 
tomentella . Twigs are grey and toment ose (woolly with 
flattened, matted hairs). Leaves are white -tomentose, 1 –  4 
in ches  and widely elliptic with obtuse tips. The margins are 
entire or blunt -toothed. Flowers bloom in Feb- Apr ( Calflora, 
1997;  Sawyer, 2012,  2016) .  
 
F. californica ssp. cuspidat a is evergreen or semi -deciduous. 
The  twigs are red, leaves are ¾ –  2 ½ in ches serrated and are 
tomentose on the lower surface in two lengths: short hairs mixed 
with conspicuous long ones. The shrub b looms in April through 
July  ( Calflora, 1997;  Sawyer,  2012; 2016) .  
 
F. californica ssp. occidentalis  is u nder  7 ft.  tall with  brown 
twigs and l eaves that are ¾  – 3 in ches  ovate to elliptic with acute 
tips and round bases. Leaf veins are not prominent. It flowers 
Mar -June and produces 3 -stoned fruit  ( Sawyer , 2012,  2016).  
 
F. californica ssp. tomentella . This subspecies is also known as 
hoary coffeeberry. It grows under 7 ft.  tall.  Its grey twigs are 
covered with hairs and l eaves are 1 – 2  ¾ in ches dull green and elliptic with an acute tip; margins are entire or blunt -toothed. 
The leaves are smooth but velvety and silvery underneath. It flowers Jan -Apr  ( Calflora, 1997;  Sawyer , 2012,  2016).

F. californica ssp. ursina is u nder 7 ft.  tall. Leaves are 1 –  3  ½ in ches , green, elliptic or ovate with an acute to rounded tip; 
the margins may be entire or serrated. They are smooth or covered with min ute hairs ( Calflora, 1997;  Sawyer,  2012,  2016) .  
 
Distribution :  Coffeeberry is widely distributed in the Western US , it is found in CA, OR, NV, AZ, and NM (USDA Plants 
profile).  F. californica ssp.  californica  g rows at elevations under 9 ,000  ft. ( Sawyer , 2016). It  is the most coastal of the 
coffeeberry subspecies growing  from southern Oregon to Orange C ounty, California. F. californica ssp.  crassifolia  g rows 
under 4,500 ft.  in  elevation and o ccurs in the Klamath Mountains and NW coastal ranges.  F. californica ssp.  cuspidata grows 
under 7,500 ft.  elevation a  in the southern Sierra Nevada mountains , Transverse, and Peninsular ranges. F. californica ssp. 
o ccidentalis  is dist ributed  under 7,500 ft.  elevation in southwestern Oregon  and northwestern California, where it is 
characteristic of mafic and ultramafic substrates ( Sawyer, 2016). F. californica ssp.  tomentella  grows under 7,500 ft.  in 
elevation  is  distributed  from the Ca scades in Oregon to the Sacramento Valley to southwestern and Baja California .  All of 
these subspecies intergrade  in intermediate habitats (Sawyer 2016 ).  F. californica ssp. ursina  is separated geographically 
from the others as in  California it is only enc ountered in San Bernardino Co. and  is otherwise found in AZ and NM (Sawyer, 
2016 ). For current distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.  
 
Habitat :  Coffeeberry  occurs  in  a diversity of habitats including chaparral, coastal sage scrub, northern sage scrub, coastal 
strand, and mixed -evergreen  forest, redwood forest, and central oak woodland plant communities.  F. californica ssp. 
c alifornica  is associated with  coastal sage scrub, desert scrub, chaparral, forest and woodland, where it is an understory 
shrub . F. californica ssp.  crassifolia  is primarily found in chaparral  and  an understory shrub in  woodland. F. californica ssp. 
cuspidata  inhabits chaparral , desert  scrub and montane woodland.  F. californica ssp.  occidentalis  is  in chaparral and 
woodland on serpentine soil sites.   F. californica ssp. tomentella  grows  in chaparral and woodland sites.  F. californica ssp. 
ursina  is  found in desert scrub and woodland ( McMurray, 1990; Sawyer 2016).   
Adaptation  
Coffeeberry generally grows on dry, sandy or rocky slopes in ravines and on hillsides and tolerates s and, clay, and even 
occasional  seasonal flooding.  It tolerates sun and light shade, and  does well as an understory plant  ( Theodore Payne 
Foundation.  2014;  Wilson, 2014) . F. californica ssp.  occidentalis  characteristically grows on mafic and ultramafic substrates 
( Sawyer, 2016).   
Uses  
Erosion Control: Coffeeberry is useful for erosion control on dry steep hillsides. Best established from transplants, the plants 
copious seed production distributed by birds can result in formation of good stands (McMurray, 1990). Once established the 
plants show continuous vegetative regeneration from established root crowns . Regeneration also occurs after fire.  
 
Ornamental:  Coffeeberry  is often cultivated as an ornamental  as the green leaves contrast well with the colored twigs and 
berries. The plant is drought tolerant, and easy to maintain.  It can be used to make an informal hedge and it tolerates pruning 
well.  Deer appear to find it less palatable than many other 
landsc ape plants  ( San Marcos Growers, 1996; Wil son, 2014). 
 
Wildlife:   In the fall when more palatable herbaceous plants have 
dried  California coffeeberry is a staple browse of big game and 
livestock. It is also important browse for mule deer on winter 
ranges in  some areas of California (McMurray, 1990). The fruits 
are  used  extensively by many wildlife species including birds, 
black tailed deer and black bears. Coffeeberry is often included 
in hedgerow plantings as it supports  beneficial insects and  the 
bloom s at tract  native bees  (Wilson, 2014) .  
Ethnobotany  
Medicinal:   Like other species in the buckthorn family, F. californica  produces a purgative effect used by native Californians 
to treat constipation  sometimes cause by consumption of acorns , a staple native  food (Chestnut 1902) .There is historical 
evidence o f widespread use of this plant by g roups such as the Chumash and Costanoan  who  dried and ground the inner bark 
to create a laxative tea (Bocek  1982; Timbrook  2007).   
 
The leaves were decocted to treat pois on oak dermatitis (Bocek 1982)  or would be directly rubbed on skin as a remedy for 
rheumatism (Timbrook  2007). They were also used to heal infected sores and wounds. Carranza et al.  (2015)  demonstrated 
the antimicrobial properties of F. californica extract s, providing scientific support for this indigenous medicinal use.  Other  
medicinal applications include using the bark to treat  influenza an d as a kidney remedy (Chestnut 1902),  and placing  a heated 
root  in the mouth for toothaches ( Ladybird Johnson Native Plant Database, 1982. ).

Status 
Threatened or Endangered:   No  
Weedy or Invasive
:  
T his  plant may become weedy or invasive in some regions or habitats and may displace desirable vegetation if not properly 
managed , it is recognized as invasive in Hawaii.  
Please consult the PLANTS Web site ( http://plants.usda.gov/
) and your  state ’s Department of Natural Resources for this 
plant’s current status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state noxiou s status, and wetland indicator values). 
Planting Guidelines 
Establishment of new plantings of coffeeberry are most successful  from transplants  and nursery stock . Although coffeeberry 
is drought tolerant, limited irrigation during  the summer for the first  year or two after transplanting increases  survival.  Direct 
seeding may be done in fall or early  winter  but the seed must be placed at a ¼ or ½ in depth as no germination wi ll occur 
with deeper planting ( ESNERR, 2001).  
Management  
Coffeeberry will regenerate  from root crowns making pruning or coppicing suitable forms of management  (McMurray, 
1990) . 
Pests and Potential Problems  
California coffeeberry is reported to be  a secondary host for the rust of velvet grass ( Puccinia spp. or  Holcus  spp.) ; there are 
no  other  reports of potential pest problems (McMurray, 1990).   
Seeds and Plant Production  
Seed collection and cleaning:  During the fruit ripening period, 
coffeeberry fruit changes color from green to red to purple -
black. Berries should be picked in early fall, before they are 
fully ripe. If harvesting is delayed, fruit can be lost to foraging 
birds. Each fruit produces 2 seed, which are hard and brown 
when mature. To clean the seed crush the fruit by hand and 
rinse them over a sieve until clean. Let them dry  and store in a 
dry and cool place.  
Pre -plant treatment :  Freshly picked seed may be planted 
immediately, but stored seed should be cold stratified for 3 
months prior to planting ( ESNERR, 2001). To cold-stratify, 
soak seeds in fresh water for 24 hours, place  them in a plastic 
bag with an equal amount of moistened perlite , and p lace the 
bag in a refrigerator M onitor the seeds every 2 weeks , checking 
for  mo isture and mold (Young,  2001).   
Planting :  Sow one seed into a container  filled with standard 
potting mix.  Plant no deeper than ¼ to ½ in . below the soil surface, as  the plant is intolerant to deep planting ( ESNERR 
2001 ). Cover lightly with soil and place in a greenhouse with an irrigation system to keep them moist. Seed should have a 
germination success of 85% (Young,  2001).  
Establishment :  Seed germinates  after 45 days. Keep seedlings in a greenhouse for 2 -3 months before moving them to a shade 
structure.  Maintain  the seedlings in a shade structure  for at least 2-3 months before planting out  in order to harden the plant to 
outside conditions. The shrub will begin to flower and fruit 3 -5 years after establishment  (ESNERR, 2001) .  
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area of origin)   
S ome commercially available ornamental cultivars include:   Frangula californica  ‘Bonita Linda ’:  This cultivar is 8 ft. tall by 
10  ft. wide with g rey-green foliage  and reddish twigs and does well in partial shade (Th eodore Payne, 2014).  Frangula 
californica  ‘ Eve case ’: This is a compact form growing 5 -8 ft. tall with a similar width. The size is  maintained by pruning. 
Introduced by the Saratoga Horticultural Foundation as a result of selection from the “Seaview” paren t cultivar. (San Marcos 
Growers, 1996) . Frangula californica  ‘Leatherleaf ’:  A  compact cultivar growing no more than 8 feet tall and wide, although 
usually not more that 5 to 6 ft. Darker leaves than other varieties, giving them a leathery appearance.  This plant was 
introduced by the UC Berkeley Botanic Garden from a selection made by Roger Raiche from Montara Mountain on a 
northern spur of the Santa Cruz Mountains near San Mateo. (San Marcos Growers, 1996) . Frangula californica  ‘Little Sur ’: 
This culti var is small and compact just 3 -4 ft. tall  and wide with  dark green foliage  (Theodore Payne, 2014).  
Frangula californica ‘Mound San Bruno ’:  More compact than other varieties and grows  only 4 -6 ft. tall and  twice as wide.  
This selection was made by Roger Raiche from plants growing on San Bruno Mountain, on the Central California Coast 
south of San Francisco (San Marcos Growers, 1996).
