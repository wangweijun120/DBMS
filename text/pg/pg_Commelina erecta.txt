ERECT DAYFLOWER

Alternate Names 
whitemouth dayflower 
 
Uses 
Erect dayflower is said to be a preferred food source 
for white-tailed deer (Chamrad & Box 1968; Drawe 
1968), so it is a good plant to consider when 
establishing deer food plots.  Erect dayflower is also 
grazed by cattle (Everitt, Draw e, & Lonard 1999).  In 
addition, its seeds are eaten by bobwhite quail, white-
winged doves, and mourning doves (Everitt, Drawe, 
& Lonard 1999).  Erect dayflower can also be a good 
plant for native area restoration projects. 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status (e.g. threat ened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description 
General : Erect dayflower ( Commelina erecta ) is a 
native, perennial, warm-season forb.  A member of 
the spiderwort (Commelinaceae) family, erect 
dayflower is said to be named for the three Commelin 
brothers who were all Dutch botanists, although only 
two were productive in their field.  Erect dayflower’s  two larger petals are said to represent the two 
Commelins who were published, while the third 
inconspicuous petal represents the unpublished 
brother (Ajilvsgi 1991).  
 
Erect dayflower has a showy blue flower that is 
attractive, but ephemeral.  Erect dayflower starts out 
erect, becoming decumbent as it matures (Correll & 
Johnston 1996). There are three varieties: erecta, 
deamiana, and angustifolia
.  Plants are highly 
variable and the individual varieties are difficult to 
distinguish (Gleason & Cronquist 1991).  Erect 
dayflower is often considered a weed (Correll & 
Johnston 1996), especially in rice fields. 
 
Distribution : For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site. 
 
Habitat: Erect dayflower can grow in both sandy and 
clayey soils in almost all habitats (Ajilvsgi 1991).  It 
is found along streambanks, in gardens, on prairies, 
along roadsides, and in waste places (Jones 1982).

Adaptation 
Erect dayflower can be found from New York and 
Wisconsin south to Arizona and Florida, west to 
Wyoming, and throughout most of the eastern United 
States.  Variety  erecta extends throughout most of the 
range of the species, while  angustifolia is primarily 
found in Texas, and  deamiana grows on sand dunes 
from Indiana and southern Michigan to Nebraska and 
is sometimes found as far south and west as Texas 
and Arizona (Gleason & Cronquist 1991).   
 
Establishment 
Erect dayflower can be grown from cuttings or seed.  
An informal germination  test conducted in the 
greenhouse at the Kika de la Garza PMC yielded a 
germination average of 87% with approximately 
twelve hours of daylight at 75 to 85ºF and twelve 
hours of darkness at 50 to 60ºF.  Cuttings of 
dayflower had about an 80% survival rate with one 
node and three node stem cuttings.  It is 
recommended that a rooting hormone be used to 
encourage rapid rooting.  Cuttings and seedlings can 
be transplanted in 6 to 8 weeks.  Irrigation is 
recommended, although not critical, at drier sites to 
help the young plants get established.  It is 
recommended that young plants be at least 6 inches 
in height before transplanting.

The use of plastic plant shelters is beneficial to 
protect young plants from heavy grazing, reduce 
plant competition, and create a more beneficial 
microclimate until young plants can get established. 
 
Management 
Weed control is a problem in a dayflower plot as the 
leggy plants make it difficult to remove the weeds 
without removing the plants.  A weed mat is 
recommended for situations, such as seed or plant 
production plantings, where weed control is a 
necessity.  In other situations, such as deer food plots, 
weed control may not be an issue.  Irrigation is 
recommended during drier periods for seed and plant 
production plantings.   
 
Seeds and Plant Production 
The seed of erect dayflower is easy to process once 
harvested.  However, the  prostrate and indeterminate 
growth form of erect dayflower results in harvests of 
very small quantities of seed.  This makes 
commercial production of large quantities of seed 
uneconomical, and limits its use for large-scale 
seedings and plantings.
