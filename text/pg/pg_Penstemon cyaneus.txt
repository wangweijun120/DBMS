Uses  
Blue penstemon is suited for use in restoration and 
wildlife enhancement plantings.  It is not noted for having 
value as forage for livestock, and forage use i s limited by 
big game. The fibrous root system and wide canopy cover 
make it a good plant for low -water use landscaping (i.e. 
roadsides) and other ornamental plantings.  
 
Blue penstemon’s large showy flowers attract pollinators 
and other insects which provi de a food source for birds 
and other animals. Blue penstemon is known to attract 
several species of native pollinators including bumble  bees (
Bombus  spp.), mason bees ( Osmia spp.) and 
Andrena  spp (Cane, 2011).    
Status  
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status ( e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
Description  
General :  Figwort family (Scrophulariaceae). Blue 
penstemon is a native  perennial sub -shrub with several 
stems arising from a branched woody caudex.  At maturity 
the plant reaches 30 to 70 cm (12 to 28 in ) tall. The basal 
leaves are clustered near the base and are approximately 
15 cm (6 in) long and 2. 5 cm (1 in) wide and petiolate. 
The stem leaves are smaller, approximately 11 cm (4 in)  
long and sessile to clasping. The inflorescence is a loose 
spike of flowers born in the upper leaf axils. The flowers 
are bright blue often suffused with pink, 2.5 to 3.5 cm (1 
to 1 .5 in) long and  about 1 cm (0.5 in) wide  at the mouth 
(Hitchcock and others, 1959). The seeds are 
approximately 2 mm (0.08 in) long.   
 
There are wide discrepancies between seed counts 
available for the species. Winslow (2011 ) obtained seed 
counts from 5 seed lots from  wildland collections made in 
Yellowstone National Park. The average for these lots 
was 13,000,000 seeds/kg (5,9 00,000 seeds/lb), while 
Lambert (2005) lists 396,000 seeds/kg (180,000 seeds/lb).  
The USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research 
Station repor ted 1,760,000 seeds/kg (800,000 seeds/lb) 
from agriculturally produced seed.   
Distribution : Blue penstemon occurs naturally throughout 
most of Idaho  and in northwestern Wyoming and 
southwestern Montana.   For current distribution , please 
consult the Plant P rofile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site.  
Habitat :  This species grows in open dry  areas on 
sagebrush slopes at  moderate elevations and in higher 
plains  (Davis, 1952) . 
Adaptation  
Blue penstemon i s adapted to well-drained, coarse soils in 
areas r eceiving 40 to 65 cm (16 to 25 in) of annual 
precipitation (University of Wyoming, 2011). Because 
blue penstemon is found in regions with long winter 
snowpack, the seed is highly dormant. Chilling periods of 
less than 24 weeks have little response in overcoming 
seed dormancy (Meyer and Kitchen 1994).
