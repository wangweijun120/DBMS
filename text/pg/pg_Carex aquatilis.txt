Uses  
Grazing/rangeland/pasture :  
Water sedge stays green late into the summer 
providing good forage when other food sources have 
gone dormant. Livestock utilization of water sedge is 
dependent  on the time of year and other available 
forage. It is listed as good palatability for cattle, 
domestic sheep, and horses with fair nutritional value 
( Hansen et al., 1990; Kovalchik and Clausnitzer, 
2004) . 
 
Wildlife :  
Water sedge is grazed by numerous speci es of geese, 
swans and other waterfowl . The vegetation also 
provides  a source of  cover  ( Derksen, et al., 1979) .The 
plants are eaten by bison, caribou, mule deer,    
white
-tailed deer, and elk ( Cowan, 1945; Hansen et 
al., 1990; Schaefer and Messier, 1995; Whitten and 
Cameron, 1980) . Water sedge sod forms overhangs 
along  streams providing cover for fish ( Hansen, et al., 
1994 ). 
 
Erosion control :  
This species has exceptional value for shoreline 
erosion control due to its prolific  rhizomatous  root 
system . It  h as  also been  used to revegetate mined 
peatlands.  
 
Ethnobotanical:   
Water sedge has been used by several North 
American native peoples for various purposes. The 
Gosiute Indians boiled and ate parts of the plant, 
while Alaska natives ate raw stem bases. The 
Hesquiat Tribe also used the leaves for basket fiber 
(Moerman, 1998).  
Status  
Water sedge is considered a species of special 
concern  in Connecticut,  endangered  in New Jersey, 
and t hreatened  in Pennsylvania  ( USDA- NRCS, 
2011) .

state noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
Description  
General : Sedge  Family ( Cyperaceae).  Water sedge is 
a  sod -forming  perennial grass -like  sedge  growing 15 
to 100 cm ( 6 to 40 in) tall. Plants arise singly or in 
groups connected by thick, long rhizomes. The stems 
or culms are triangular in cross section.  Leaves are 
borne on the lower half of the  stems; the blades are 
1.5 t o 5.5 mm ( 0.06 to 0.22 in) wide  and can be 
shorter or longer than the culms. Each culm has a 
leaf -like , 3 to 19 cm ( 1.2 to 7.5 in) long bract 
subtending the inflorescence.  The inflorescence 
consists of 1 to 3 staminate spikes above 2 to 3 
pistillate spikes , often with some androgynous (male 
and female with male flowers on top) transitional 
spikes. The terminal staminate spike is 1 to 3.5 cm 
( 0.4 to 1.4  in) long. The pistillate spikes are 1.5 to 4.5 
cm ( 0.6 to 1.8  in) long and 3 to 5 mm ( 0.12 to 0.20 
in) wid e. Each fruit (achene) is subtended  by a 
lanceolate to rounded, blackish or black purple scale, 
shorter to longer and narrower than the perigynia. 
The scale has a green to pale brown  midrib. Each 
achene is enclosed in a perigynium, a leathery sack -

(90 to 110° F). Night time temperatures average 
around 30° C (85° F). Grow lights are kept on during 
nighttime hours. 
 
First emergence occurs around 5 to 7 days after 
planting. Full stands (90 -100%) are reached in 12 
days.  
 
After full establishment, plants can be  fertilized once 
per week with Miracle Grow All Purpose Plant Food 
(15 -30- 15). After 30  days the irrigation amount 
should be  increased to 3 minutes/hr from 9:00 am to 
5:00 pm and grow lights are turned off. Greenhouse 
day time temperatures are reduced to 30 to 32°C (85 
to 90° F).  Plants are ready for transplanting in 3 
months.  
 
Establishment  
Wild plants can be collected and transplanted directly 
into the desired project site.  Care should be taken not 
to collect plants from weedy areas as these weeds can 
be relocated to the transplant site and the hole left at 
the collection site may fill with  undesirable species.  
 
For wetland plantings using greenhouse grown 
transplants or  wildings, plant at 15, 30 or 60 cm ( 0.5, 
1.0 or 2.0 ft)  spacing for uniform ground cover in 1, 2 
and 3 years respectively.  Seedlings can be hand -
planted or dibbled into mois t soil or standing water. 
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials  
Wild collected seed is commercially available, but 
there are no known releases of water sedge.
