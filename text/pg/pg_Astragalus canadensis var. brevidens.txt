Alternate Names 
Canadian milkvetch, Astragalus spicatus, Astragalus 
tristis, Astragalus mortonii, Astragalus torreyi, 
Astragalus brevidens  
 
Uses 
Primary uses include wild life cover and native plant 
community restoration. 
 
Ethnobotanic: The Blackfoot dug them in the spring 
for eating (Kindscher 1987).  Canada milkvetch was 
often used in a broth (Moerman, 1998).   
 
Medical : The root is analgesic and antihaemorrhagic 
and can be chewed or used as a tea to treat chest and 
back pains, coughs and spiting up of blood.  A 
poultice made from the chew ed root has also been 
used to treat cuts (Moerman, 1998).   
 
Status 
Currently, it is not listed as threatened or endangered 
in the areas where it occurs naturally, though the 
species is listed in se veral eastern states.  Please  consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status (e.g. threat
ened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description 
General :  Legume family (Fab aceae).  Short-toothed 
Canada milkvetch is a native, rhizomatous, perennial 
legume.  It has a lower, comparatively more robust 
growth than  A. canadensis  var. mortonii.  The erect or 
sometimes horizontal and ascending stems are 
usually 6 – 22 inches long, herbage usually paler 
green.  The leaves are usually 2 – 6 inches long. The 
leaves are smooth or sometimes with minute hairs 
giving a grayish appearance; with 15 to 23 leaflets 
that are 1/4 to 1 1/4 inches long.  The small hairs of 
the leaves and stems are sh aped like picks, attached 
in the middle.  The flower s are yellowish white, straw 
colored to greenish white, sometimes tinged with dull 
purple, with a pea flower shap e, located at the ends of 
long stalks.  The fruit is a grooved pod, 10 to 15 
millimeters long and divided into two cells with 
usually 18 – 25 seeds.  (Barneby, 1964) 
 
Chromosome number: 2N=16  (Hu, et al, 2006) 
 
Distribution : Astragalus canadensis  var. brevidens 
occurs nearly throughout the western and northern 
Great and Columbia Basins, from east central and 
northeastern California to interior Washington and 
southern British Columbia, east to the upper Missouri 
River in southwestern Montana, the upper North 
Platte River in southern Wyoming and northwestern 
Colorado, northern Utah and central Nevada and 
southwestern Utah. (Barneby, 1964) 
 
For current distribution,  please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site. 
 
Habitat: It is found commonly with sagebrush but 
ascends along water courses into dry habitat pine 
forest, is widespread, common and locally abundant, 
often forming extensive clumps or colonies, nearly 
throughout the western and northern Great and 
Columbia Basins.  (Barneby, 1964) 
 
Adaptation 
Short-toothed Canada milkvetch is found in moist, 
but often summer-dry bottomlands, ditches, creek 
banks, lake shores, hillsides around springs and 
seeps, alkaline meadows and depressions on rolling

plains, rarely in dry (or apparently dry) sandy or 
gravelly soils of brushy hills or lava flows, at 
elevations of 750 feet in the north but commonly at 
1500-8100 feet, mostly in stiff, often alkaline, water 
deposited soils of diverse origin.  (Barneby, 1964) 
 
Establishment 
Propagation by Seed:  Short-toothed Canada 
milkvetch seed should be scarified before planting.  It 
has potential for high incidence of hard seed in the 
order of 85 to 90 percent.  Scarified seed of good 
quality should germinate at a range of 85 to 90 
percent or more.  Plant seed in a firm, weed-free seed 
bed.  Seed should be kept shallow, at ½ inch or less.  
Emergence in a controlled temperature setting in a 
growth chamber occurred in four days with 
temperature set at 70
0 F.  Early indications at 
Pullman, WA are that short-toothed Canada 
milkvetch should be spring seeded. 
 
The average number of seeds per pound is 300,000, 
based on work with one selection at the Pullman 
Plant Materials Center. 
 
Management  
Seed production hinges  on successful cross 
pollination of flowers by insects. Careful thought 
should be given to this fact when applying pesticides 
in the vicinity of Canada milkvetch plants. 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Short-toothed Canada milkvetch may be subject to 
predation by cutworms and rodents such as gophers 
which reduce the number of plants in the stand. 
 
Environmental Concerns 
Short-toothed Canada milkvetch has the potential for 
causing locoism in elk and livestock.  Plants may 
contain a nitrotoxin (3-nitropropanoic acid) which is 
very detrimental to the animals.   
 
Plant samples of the Pullman Plant Materials Center 
selection were sent to the USDA Agricultural 
Research Service Pois onous Plant Research 
Laboratory in 2003 for analysis. Vegetative and 
flower stage materials tested positive for nitrotoxin.  
Seed tested negative. 
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and 
area of origin) 
Currently, there are no  known cultivars of short-
toothed Canada milkvetch on the commercial market. 
 
The Pullman Washington Plant Materials Center has 
a selection of short-toothed Canada milkvetch that is 
scheduled for release.  It wa s collected at Silver Lake 
in Lake County in south central Oregon. 
 
‘Sunrise’ Canada milkvetch ( Astragalus 
canadensis)was released with  exclusive production 
rights in 1997 by the South Dakota Agricultural 
Experiment Station (Boe and Fluharty, 1998).  
‘Sunrise’ originated from  a native population near 
Brookings, SD.  In March, 2006 seed was not 
available of this release (Lund, 2006).  
 
The Bismarck North Dakota  Plant Materials Center 
has worked with a selection of Canada milkvetch but 
does not plan to release the selection for commercial 
production.
