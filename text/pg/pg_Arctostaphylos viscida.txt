Wildlife  
Manzanita not only provides habita t to many Pacific 
animals, but  suppli es food to them as well.  It has thick 
foliage (shrubbery) that offers man y animals cover from 
predation.  Small mammals, song birds and game birds eat 
and enjoy the fruits a ll throughout the summer ( Kauffman 
and  Martin , 1991; Martin, 1951) (Table 1).  Then through 
fecal deposition the animals disperse A. viscida  se eds 
(Kauffman and Martin, 1991). Deer frequently  forage on 
the  twigs and leaves  (Martin  et al., 1951) ( Table 1).
