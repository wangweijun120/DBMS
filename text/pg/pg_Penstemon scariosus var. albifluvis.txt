General : Figwort  family ( Scrophulariaceae).  White 
River penstemon is a herbaceous perennial forb with 
multiple stems arising from a woody root crown.  
Mature plants are approximately 15 to 50 cm ( 6 to 20 
in) tall. Leaves are oppos ite, linear to linear-
lanceolate, 3 to 17 cm ( 1.2 to 6.7 in) long and 2 to 23 
mm ( 0.08 to 0.91 in)  wide. The inflorescence is a 
glandular -pubescent, congested raceme bearing pale 
blue to lavender flowers. The flower is comprised of 
five petals fused to for m a bilateral tube 
approximately 20 to 22 mm ( 0.79 to 0.87 in) long. 
The staminode (sterile stamen) is 9 to 10 mm (0.35 to 
0.4 in) long, and the fertile stamens are 10 to 11 ( 0.4 
to 0.43 in) long. The anther sacs are dark blue, 1.3 to 
2.6 mm ( 0.05 to 0.10 in) long,  and moderately 
bearded wi th white slender flexuous hairs. The anther 
sacs dehisce nearly the full length, except  across the 
center connective tissue (Welsh et al., 2003).  The 
fruit is a capsule;  8 to 11 mm ( 0.31 to 0.43 in) long 
bearing 10 to 20,  2 mm ( 0.08 in) long seeds ( USDI-
FWS, 2010). Flowering occurs in May and early 
June, with fruiting and seed set in late June 
(Lewinsohn and Tepedino, 2007).  
 
Distribution : 
White River penstemon occurs in 15 sites forming an 
arc from Rio Blanco County, Colorado west of 
Rangely, Colorado and westward into southern 
Uintah County, Utah. Total area occupied by known 
populations is approximately 200 acres ( USDI-FWS, 
2010).  Approximately 70 percent of White River 
penstemon habitat is located on public lands manage d 
by the USDI -BLM.

page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.  
 
Habitat :  
White River penstemon grows in mixed desert shrub 
and pinyon -juniper communities on sparsely 
vegetated shale slopes. Plants gr owing in association 
with this species include shadscale ( Atriplex 
confertifolia ), yellow rabbitbrush ( Ericameria 
viscidiflorus ), Salina wildrye ( Elymus salinus) Indian 
ricegrass ( Achnatherum hymenoides ), pinyon pine 
( Pinus edulis ) and Utah juniper ( Juniperus
