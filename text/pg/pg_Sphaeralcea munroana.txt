Sphaeralcea munroana. Pamela Pavek  
Alternate Names 
Orange globemallow, desert mallow,  whitestem 
globemallow ( S. munroana ssp.  subrhomboidea), 
Malva munroana, Nuttallia munroana, Malvastrum 
munroana, Malveopsis munroana  
 
Uses 
Pollinator habitat:    Munr o’s gl obemallow attracts 
many species of bees, a few of which are specialists, 
requiring pollen an d nectar only from Sphaeralcea 
and related genera.   These include the ground -nesting 
bees  Diadasia diminuta , D. lutzi,  and Colletes 
sphaeralcea .   The  Diadasia  are proficient and  dedicated pollinators, and have been found 
colonizing trial plots on research farms (Cane 2011). 
  
 
Forage:   Plants in the  Sphaeralcea genus are 
important forage source s for  a num ber of rodents, 
rabbits and other lagomorphs,  and ungulates  such as 
deer and antelope  (Beale and Smith 1970;  Pendery 
and Rumbaugh 1986, Rumbaugh et al. 1993).   
B rowsing  deer will  often  consume al l of the foliage 
and leave only the woody ba se.   
 
Ornamental:   Munr o’s globemallow is hardy to Zone 
4 and is recommended  for rock gardens, banks, desert 
shr ub areas, and along drivewa ys and walkwa ys 
(Rugged Country Plants 2011).   This plant is also 
s uitable for container planting (Cane 2011).  For  an  
attractive  appearance, High Country Gardens (2011) 
suggests cutting the plants to  the ground level every 
year .   
 
Range revegetation:  This plant is one of the gems of 
the arid west.  It can be used to add aesthetic beauty 
and diversity to range landscap es. 
 
Ethnobotanical:  People of the Gosiute tribe made 
paint with the flowers and applied it to the inside of 
their earthenware dishes (Native American 
Ethn obotany Database 201 1). 
Status

state noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
Description 
General:   Mallow family (Malvaceae).  Sphaeralcea 
munroana  is a native perennial forb or subshrub.   It 
has  a taproot, an open bran ching form and grows to 
20 to 80  cm  (8 to 32  inches) tall.  Leaves and stems 
are pale green  and have a slightly rough texture  due 
to a covering of fine white hairs.  Leaves are 
alternate, petiolate, have round -toothed margins,  
thr ee to five lobes, and are 2 to 6 cm (0.8 to 2.4 in) 
long.  Flower s  and buds  are on showy clusters in leaf 
axils  and  bloom  May through August . The f lowers 
have a diameter of 2 cm (0.75 in),  five  pale orange to 
brick -red  petals ,  and  numerous  stamens .  Seeds are 
produced in dr y  fruits with multiple capsules that 
form a sphere , and there is one seed per capsule .  
S eeds  are pubescent and  average 1.5 mm  (0.06 in) in 
length (Rydberg 1917 ; Lyons and Merilees 1995; 
Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture 2011).

Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and 
ar ea of origin) 
‘ARS -2892’ is select -class germplasm released by 
the ARS in  1993.  Seed  was collected from plants 
gr owing on the Hyrum Lake Dam in Cache County, 
UT an d  compared to 49 other accessions of 
Sphaeralcea  species. It was selected for its large 
shoot size, succulence, leafy gr owth form and seed 
yield potential (Rumbaugh and Pendery 1993).
