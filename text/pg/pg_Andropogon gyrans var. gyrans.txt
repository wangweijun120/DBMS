Alternate Names 
Andropogon campyloracheus, Andropogon elliottii, 
Andropogon elliottii var. gracilior, Andropogon 
elliottii  var. projectus, Andropogon subtenuis.  
 
Uses  
Elliott’s bluestem is grazed readily by cattle during 
spring and early summer.  Forage quality is relatively 
high when green.  Protei n concentrate should be 
provided when grazed during dormant season. 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status, such as, state noxious status and 
wetland indicator values. 
 
Description 
Elliott’s bluestem is a warm-season, perennial bunch 
grass.  The height is usually 2-1/2 to 3 feet.  The leaf 
blade is 6 to 15 inches long , smooth except for cluster 
of hair just above ligule.  The leaf sheath is a basal 
sheath that is keeled, overl apping, relatively narrow; 
and has rounded upper sheaths.  The stem is erect; 1 
to 6 per plant, branching near  top.  The seedhead is a 
raceme, partially enclosed  in conspicuous enlarged 
spathe, which turns a rusty  color when plant matures.

Management 
Although of fair grazing value,  this grass is seldom, if 
ever, abundant enough to be a key management 
species.  It usually makes up no more than 3 to 5 
percent of the plant composition.  Proper grazing of 
more plentiful associated  grasses maintains proper 
percentage of this grass in the plant community. 
 
Establishment 
New growth starts in early spring but most of growth 
is made during spring and summer.  Seedheads 
develop during fall, and seedstalks remain for several 
months.  Distinctive seedhead clusters make plants 
conspicuous after maturity.  Grows best in open areas 
but tolerates some shade.  Adapts primarily to 
well-drained soils on uplands and does not tolerate 
wet sites.
