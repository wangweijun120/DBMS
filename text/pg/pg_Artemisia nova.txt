Uses  
Wildlife/livestock.  Black sagebrush provides good forage 
to wildlife and livestock. Ogle  and Brazee (2009) rate it 
as preferred forage for deer and antelope year round, and 
preferred for sheep during winter and fall and desirable in 
spring and summer. Palatability of black sagebrush varies 
from one population to the next. Preference test resu lts 
between black sagebrush and big sagebrush subspecies 
are variable and largely inconclusive  (McArthur and 
Stevens, 2004) . Welsh et al. (1994) reported winter 
nutritive values of black sagebrush at 53.7 % in vitro 
digestibility, 9.9 % crude protein and 0.18 % phosphorus.  
 
Conservation. Black sagebrush establishes readily and 
spreads naturally by seed. It is a good conservation 
species for dry sites with shallow soils (McArthur and 
Stevens, 2004).  
Status  
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current  status (
e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
Description  
General :  Sunflower family (Asteraceae).  Black 
sagebrush is a low growing evergreen shrub with a flat 
topped crown. Mature plants range from 10 to 30 cm ( 4 to 
12  in) tall. The leaves are dark green, sometimes grayish, 
triangular in outline with 3 rounded lobes. The leaf 
surface is often covered with hair, a feature which 
distinguishes this species from big sagebrush species ( A. 
tridentata ) (McArthur and Stevens, 2004) . These hairs 
give the leaves a darker appearance. The slender floral 
stems  stand 4 to 10 cm ( 1.6 to 4 in) above the vegetative  
crown.  The flower heads typically contain 3 or 4 perfect 
disk flowers. The fruit is an achene, 0.8 to 1.5 m m ( 0.03 
to 0.06 in) in length with no pappus.  
 
This species resembles low sagebrush ( A. arbuscula), but 
can be s eparated  by  its having entire leave s on the 
flowering stems  and stalked flower heads . Big sage brush 
differs from black sagebrush in having  green and hairy 
involucral bracts or phyllaries around the flower heads; 
those of black sagebrush  are straw colored and glabrous  
( Shultz , 2009) .  
 
There  are two varieties  of black sagebrush, the common 
variety  nova and variety duchensicola. Variety 
duchensicola  has whitish leaves , pubescent phyllaries, 
and larger flower heads with 5 flowers per head (Welsh et 
al, 2003). This variety occurs sporadically in  Utah, 
Nevada and California ( Shultz, 2009).  
 
Black sagebrush readily hybridizes with other members of 
section Tridentatae resulting in narrow bands of 
intermediate forms situated between populations (Welsh 
et al., 2003) . However black sagebrush typically occupies 
sites unsuited to other sagebrush species and forms 
distinct plant communities.  
Distribution :  Black sagebrush is widely distributed in the 
western United States. It occurs in arid regions of western 
North America in Arizona, California, Colorado,  Idaho, 
Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and 
Wyoming  (Shultz, 2009) . 
For current distribution, please 
consult the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site.  
 
Habitat :  Black sagebrush is p rimarily found in low desert 
scrub communities in valley bottoms or on sparsely 
vegetated mountain slopes. It often occurs in solid stands 
as the dominant or co -dominant species. Black sagebrush 
is often found in association with horsebrush  (Tetradymia

cleaning (Barner, 2009; Wasser, 1982). There are 
approximately  907,000 seeds/lb (Ogle et al., 2011).  
 
Germination rates in lab tests are highly variable  with 
some seed germinating within a few days and other seed 
not germinating for 90 or more days (Wasser, 1982).  This 
is most likely a reflection of the conditions at the 
collection site. Stands in montane areas are more likely to 
have a longer stratificati on period than seeds collected 
from desert locations. A two week stratification period is 
recommended (Meyer et al., 1988).   
 
Seeded stands flowered after 4 years in Utah (Wasser, 
1982).  
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin)  
Pine  Valley Ridge source is a selected germplasm of 
black sagebrush developed by the Intermountain Research 
Station in Ogden, Utah (Welch et al., 1994). It was shown 
to be preferred by wintering deer and was palatable to 
domestic livestock. It is adapted to sites with a minimum 
18  cm ( 7 in) mean annual precipitation, well drained soils  
with pH from 6.6 to 8.8 and a growing season of 75 days 
or more (Welch et al., 1994).   
 
In addition to the formal named release, there may also be 
unnamed selections/ecotypes of this species readily 
available from commercial sources.”
