Uses  
Commercial crop:  Peas are a cool -season crop grown for 
their edible seed or seed pods .  Different types of peas are 
grown for various purposes .   Garden or green peas are 
harvested before the seed is mature  for the fresh or f resh-
pack market  ( Elzebroek and Wind , 2008) .  Sugar  snap 
peas and snow peas lack  the  inner pod fiber  and  are also 
harvested early for the fresh or fresh -pack market  
(McGee,  2012) .  Field pea s, including fall -sown Austrian 
winter peas,  are harvested when seeds are mature and dry,  and are primarily blended with grains to fortify the 
protein content of livestock feed.  
Dried peas are also sold 
for human consumption as whole, split or ground peas.  
Peas are a nutritious legume , containing 15 to 35% 
protein, and high concentrations of the essential amino 
acids lysine and tryptophan (Elzebroek and Wind , 2008).    
 
Forage crop:   Peas are grown  alone or with cereals for 
silage and green fodder  (Elzebroek and Wind , 2008) .  
Peas can also be grazed  while in the field.  Young 
Austrian winter pea plants will regrow after being grazed 
multiple times (Clark , 2007).  
 
Rotational crop:   Peas and other legumes are desirable in 
crop rotations because they break up disease and pest 
cycles , provide nitrogen,  improve soil microbe  diversity 
and  activity , improve  soil aggregat ion, conserve soil 
water, and provide  economic diversity  (Veseth , 1989; 
Lupwayi et al. , 1998; Biederbeck et al. , 2005; Chen et al. , 
2006 ).   
 
Green manure and cover crop: Peas  are grown as  green 
manure s and  cover crop s because they  grow quickly and 
contribute nitrogen to the soil  (Ingels et al. , 1994;  Clark, 
2007 ).  Pea roots have nodules, formed by the bacteria 
Rhizobium  leguminosarum , which convert atmospheric 
nitrogen (N
2) to ammonia (NH3) .  Peas also produce an 
abundance  of succulent vines that breakdown quickly and 
provide nitrogen (Sarrantonio , 1994 , as cited by Clark , 
2007 ).  Austrian winter pea s are the most common  type of 
pea  used  as a green manure or cover crop  because  they 
are  adapted  to cold  temperatures and fit  in many  rotations.  
 
Status  
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status ( e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland in dicator values). 
Description  
General:  Leg ume family (Fabaceae).  The pea is a cool -
season annual  vine that is smooth  and has a  bluish -green 
waxy appearance.  V ines can be up to 9 ft long, however 
modern cultivars  have shorter  vines , about 2  ft  long.  The 
stem is hollow, and the taller cultivars cannot climb 
without support (Elzebroek and Wind , 2008) .  Leaves are 
alternate, pinnately compound, and consist of two large 
leaflike  stipules, one to several pairs of oval leaflets , and 
terminal tendril s (McGee, 2012).  Many modern cultivars 
have  a semi -leafless or ‘afila’ leaf type in which the 
leaflets are converted into additional tendrils (McGee,  
2012).

and Phoma medicaginis  var.  pinodella ), powdery mildew 
( Eryisphe pisi ), downy mildew (Peronospora viciae f. sp.  
pisi ), septoria blight ( Septoria pisi), and  white mold 
( Sclerotinia sclerotiorum ).  Rhizoctonia ( Rhizoctonia 
solani ) and Pythium  ( Pythium  spp.) are common seed rot 
and seedling damping- off diseases.  Common root rots 
include F usarium root rot ( Fusarium solani  f. sp. pisi ), 
Aphanomyces  root rot ( Aphanomyces euteiches ), and 
Fusarium  wilt ( Fusarium oxysporum  f. sp. pisi ).  
Economically important pea viral diseases include bean 
yellow mosaic (BYMV), pea enation mosaic (PEMV), 
p ea seedborne mosaic virus  (PSbMV), red clover vein 
mosaic virus (RCVMV)  and p ea streak virus (PeSV).    
Insect pests include pea aphids ( Acyrthosiphon pisum), 
pea leaf miners ( Liriomyza huidobrensis ), pea leaf 
weevils ( Sitona lineatus ), pea seed weevils ( Bruchus 
pisorum ), Lygus  bugs ( Lygus spp.), spider mites (various 
species), and seed corn maggots ( Delia platura).  
Nematodes (various species) can also be problematic in 
local areas (Kraft and Pfleger, 2001; McGee, 2012).  
Environmental Concerns  
None.  
Seeds  and Plant Production  
Depending on the cultivar, there can be  1,000 to 3,000 
pea seeds per pound  (Elzebroek and Wind , 2008).   The 
average yields  in the U.S. during the years 2007 –  2011 
were :  Austrian winter peas  1,319 lb/ac re; dry edible peas 
1,828 lb/ac re, and wrinkled peas 616,800 CWT ( USDA-
National Agricultural Statistics Service , 2012).  
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin)  
Numerous  pea cultivars are available.  Breeders have 
selected for height, v egetative growth form, seas on of 
maturity , disease resistance, pod shape  and length, seed 
color, tenderness, sweetness,  seed shape, number of seeds 
per pod, and pod production per node  (Hartmann et al. , 
1988;  Elzebroek and Wind , 2008) . 
 
Producers in the Palouse  region  of the Inland Pacific 
Northwest  (eastern Washington,  northern Idaho and 
northeastern Oregon)  grow many different types of peas , 
including the following types and cultivars .  Green field 
peas:  ‘Aragorn ’, ‘Ariel’, ‘Banner’ and ‘CDC Striker’ ; 
forage  peas: ‘ 40 -10’, ‘Trapper’, ‘CDC Sonata ’ and ‘Flex’;  
m arrowfat p eas (for the  snack food market and mushy 
peas in UK): ‘Micichi’, ‘Midlea’, and ‘ 22-5’;  m ap le peas 
(racing pigeon food) : ‘Co urier’, ‘CDC Mosaic’, and 
‘CDC Rocket’  (McGee,  2012) . 
 
Producers in Montana, N orth Dakota, Alberta and 
Saskatchewan  primarily grow yellow field peas.  
Cultivars include ‘ Bridger’, ‘Delta ’, ‘DS Admiral’, 
‘ Carousel’,  ‘CDC Agassiz’ , and ‘Cutlass’ (McGee,  2012).  
  F
all- planted  field pea cultivars in the Palouse and 
northern  Great Plains include ‘ Specter’, ‘Windham’, 
‘Whistler’, ‘Granger’ and ‘Melrose’ (McGee,  2012).  
 
Cultivars often planted as  green manure or cover crops 
include ‘Granger ’, ‘Melrose’ , and ‘Magnus ’ (Clark, 
2007).
