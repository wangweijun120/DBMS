Description  
General :  Pearl millet ( Pennisetum glaucum ) is an 
introduced, annual, warm -season crop widely grown 
throughout the United States  for grazing,  hay,  cover crop, 
and wildlife.  There are approximately 1.5 million acres in 
production  in the US (Myers, 200 2). It is a bunch grass  
grow ing 4 –8 ft tall, on smooth ½ –1 in ch diameter stems, 
wit h upright side shoots (tillers).  Compared to sorghum, it 
will produce more tillers and has a woodier stem (Kajuna, 
2001).  The inflorescence (4 –20 in) is a terminal spike, 
resembling that of cattail.  Seeds are cylindrical,  typically 
white,  or  yellow, but there are varieties  with color s 
ranging  from brown to purple.  Leaf blades are long and 
pointed.   
 
Pearl millet’ s deep root system grows rel atively fast 
(Hannaway and Larson, 2004), and  can scavenge residual 
nutrient s. It  is a good choice for low -input sustainable 
agricultural systems.   
 
Distribution :  Pearl millet can be grown throughout the 
continental United States and Puerto Rico. It is widely 
distributed across Africa, India, and Asia.  For current  distribution, 
please consult the Plant Profile page for this 
species on the PLANTS Web site.  
 
Habitat :  Pearl millet is thought to have originated from 
the Sahel region in  Africa (Hannaway and Larson, 2004). 
It is a n obligate  upland or facultative upland plant, 
dependin g on the region where it is grown. It almost 
never occurs in wetlands in the a rid West, but may 
occasionally occur in a wetland in the Atlantic and Gulf 
Coastal Plain, Eastern Mountains and Piedmont, and 
Great Plains. It grows well on sandy and acidic soils.   
 
Adaptation  
In the Southeast Coastal Plains of the United States, p earl 
millet is grown mainly in well -drained sandy or light 
loams , and can survive low pH and fertility. Generally, it 
grows best in regions where sorghum is grown. It is one 
of the most  drought resistant grains (Lee et al., 2012) , but 
cannot  survive standing water.  It can grow with annual 
precipitation as low as 16– 26 in, but it will not grow well 
above  6,500– 9,000 ft (2,000–  2,700 m) (Hannaway and 
Larson, 2004).  
Uses  
Forage /Feed:   Pearl millet  is used by livestock producers 
for grazing, silage, hay, and green chop (Newman et al., 
2010).  It  is the preferred choice for forage when 
compared to similar warm -season millets such as 
browntop, Japanese, and proso millet. Pearl millet 
production  for grain is mainly used for poultry feed 
(Myers, 2002). It is considered equal to or  better than 
typical  corn-soybean broiler chicken  feed (Gulia et al., 
2007).  Unlike sorghum, pearl millet does not produce 
prussic acid or have tannins, so is safe to feed to horses 
(Newman et al., 2010).  Swine have been shown to reach 
slaughter  weight earlie r on pearl millet than on  a  corn  diet 
(Gulia et al., 2007) . Terrill et al. (1998) found pearl millet 
could be effectively used as a substitute for corn feed in 
goat diets.  
 
Pearl millet  has a high potential for  accumulatin g toxic 
levels of nitrate, especially on the lower 6 in (15 cm) of 
the stalks (Strickland et al., 2007). It is best to avoid 
grazing younger plants and to avoid overgrazing. 
D roughty  or cold  weather can  stress plants and  increase 
nitrate levels. Pearl millet may contain higher levels of 
nitrate than sorghum -sudan grass after hot weather, 
however n itrate returns to safe levels 7 –14 days after a 
drought -ending rain (Strickland et al., 2007) . Pearl millet 
feed can be diluted by mixing with low nitrate feeds. 
Ne wman et al. (2010) observe that haying material does 
not  reduce nitrate concentrations, but ensiling the forage  
can decrease nitrate levels 40 –60%.   
 
Natural Resources Conservation Service  Plant Guide

Pearl millet  can have a  crude pr otein (CP) level  of 12–
14% (Lee et al., 20012) , higher than that of corn silage  
(Banks and Stewart, 1998), with relatively low fiber and 
lignin concentration (Newman et al., 2010). Davis et al. 
(2003) note d that the protein content of pearl millet is 
greater than corn and found that broiler  chicken  diets with 
50% pearl mi llet performed better than corn -soybean 
diets.  Pearl millet  will have higher CP levels if it fertilized 
with N. Stems left standing in the field after grain harvest 
are low in digestibility and n utrients (Newman et al., 
2010).  
 
Due to pearl millet’s  large stems, hay production is 
difficult without a hay or mower conditioner, and extra 
time will be needed for dr ying. Rotational grazing is 
recommended,  as it requires less management  (Newman 
et al., 2010) . It can be grazed /cut when it reaches 3 ft 
(Hannaway and Larson, 2004)  approximately 60– 65 
DAP . 
 
Cover crop/green manure:   When used as a cover crop, 
pearl millet may suppress soil -borne diseases and increase 
soil  organic matter.  Pearl millet has a C:N ratio greater 
than  50, w hich is not as favorable as a legume cover crop 
for releasing scavenged  N to a following crop (Wang and 
Nolte, 2010) . Nevertheless,  Rosolem et al. (2004) found 
that pearl millet used as a cover crop enhanced N use 
efficiency by a following maize crop.   
 
Pearl millet is tall and produces  3 -5 ton/ac of  dry matter 
biomass , similar to sorghum -sudangrass (Schonbeck and 
Morse, 2006) , and so can be used as a good surface 
mulch . It  can  be killed by mowing , rolling , and  exposure 
to freezing temperatures.  Decaying pearl millet plants left 
on the soil surface retained 60 –80% of potassium  in the 
straw for the following crop (Rosolem et al., 2005).   
 
Pearl millet has high root density , root dry matter, and 
vegetative vigor,  and is especially well suited to break up 
compacted soil (Rosolem et al., 2001).  Like other grass 
cover crops ( sorghum for example),  it develops rapid ly , 
covers  the soil surface, and has  an extensive, fibrous  root  
system . Pearl millet is compatible in mixes with forage 
legumes like cowpea ( Vigna unguiculata), lab lab ( Lablab 
purpureus ), or sunn hemp ( Crotalaria juncea ) (Cook et 
al., 2005).  
 
Used as a rotation crop, pearl millet has been shown to 
control root -lesion nematodes in potatoes (Ball- Coelho et 
al. , 2003)  and tobacco (Belair, et al., 2002) . When rotated 
with triticale, pearl millet was able to increase soybean 
yields in c ompacted soils compared to treatments 
terminated with chiseling (Calonego and Rosolem, 2010).   
 
Wildlife:   Pearl millet seed  is used as a food source for 
birds and is used in wild birdseed mixes. Goldfinches, 
juncos, quail, turkey,  doves, and ducks use pearl millet 
seed  as a food source (Gulia et al., 2007).  It has been 
included in wildlife mixes that reduce erosion in critical  area plantings, like mineland reclamation (KYDFWR, 
1995).
 
Ethnobotany  
Pearl millet has been used as a food crop for thousands of 
years  in a variety of food products , and continues to be 
used as a staple grain by approximately 90 million people 
in Africa and India  (Gulia et al., 2007).  It contains more 
nutrients than rice or wheat, but is considered a  
subsistence  crop for poorer countries (Kajuna , 2001). 
Pearl millet grain contains higher gross energy than  corn, 
higher concentrations of amino acids, and 27– 32% more 
protein (Gulia et al., 2007).  As a gluten -free food product, 
pearl millet is becoming  popular in the growing health -
food market (Gulia et al., 2007).  
Status  
Weedy or Invasive
:  Pearl  millet has an extremely low 
potential for weediness, especially in g razing 
management systems ( Cook et al., 2005).
 Please consult 
with your local NRCS Field Office, Cooperative 
Extension Service office, state natural resource, or state 
agriculture department regarding its status and use.
 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site 
( http://plants.usda.gov/
)  an d your State Department of 
Natural Resources for this plant’s current status (e.g., 
threatened or endangered species, state noxious status, 
and wetland indicator values).  
Planting Guidelines 
Germination occurs at  or above  54˚F (12˚C) (Hannaway 
and Larson, 2004) and i f conditions are optimal, seedlings 
will emerge in 2 –4 days . The optimal temperature for 
growth  ranges from  77– 86˚F (25– 30˚C) (Hannaway and 
Larson, 2004)  to 91 –95˚F (32– 35˚C) (Newman et al., 
2010).  Within 14 DAP , the plant will begin to grow 
rapidly.  Growing guidelines and planting windows for 
pearl millet are similar to sorghum. Plant 12 –15 lb/ac 
drilled, and 30 –40  lb/ac broadcast. Rows should be drilled 
at 36 inches if there is a need  to  cultivate  for wee d 
control.  
 
Pearl millet is a low -input crop with low nutrient 
demand s,  requir ing few additional nutrients. Its nutrient 
needs can be met through the use of animal manure or 
rotatio ns with a leguminous cover crop (Myers, 2002).  
Management  
Pearl millet is c ommonly planted after a  spring small 
grain or vegetable crop. It will re -grow after cutting to 6 –
8 in and  may be cut up to twice during a growing season 
(Banks and Stewart, 1998). After grazing to 6– 8 in, pearl 
millet should be allowed to regrow to 14– 24 in before 
being grazed again. Mowing off seedheads may 
encourage more vegetative growth (Hancock Seed, 2014). 
Some defoliation will help maintain the quality of the 
stand  and irrigation or rainfall is beneficial and important 
for  seed development (Hannaway and Larson, 2004).

Pests and Potential Problems 
Pearl millet is affected by fall armyworm and rust, or 
leafspot (Newman et al., 2014).  In parts of the United 
States , grain production is limited by  rust disease (Davis, 
et al., 200 3).  
Environmental Concerns  
There is very little threat of pearl millet spreading 
naturally . Please contact your local agricultural extension 
specialist or county weed specialist to determine if  this 
plant is considered a weed  in your area.  
Seeds and Plant Production  
Pearl millet is cross -pollinated, with flowers opening on 
the inflorescent spike from the top down.  It  can produce 
225– 700 lb/ac to 3,500 lb/ac  of seed  (Lee et al., 2012), 
with  approximately  40,000–60,000 seeds/lb (Newman et 
al., 2010)  to  90,900 seeds/lb (Hannaway and Larson, 
2004).  
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin)   
Newman  et al. (2010) describe s two types of pearl millet: 
dwarf and tall. The former is leafier and is used for 
grazing, while the latter produces higher  seed  yield.  The 
higher yielding variety can produce 9,300– 9,900 lb/ac dry 
matter  (Newman et al., 2010) . Short  and tall varieties 
have approximately the same number of leaves (Hancock 
Seed, 2014). Varieties HGM 486 and HGM 686 are 
hybrids, so will only  yield the same type of plant as the 
intentional hybrid  if new seed is purchased every year. 
Pearl millet cv.  TifGrain 102  has been shown to be a 
successful alternative poultry feed , in the Southeast 
Coastal Plain (Davis et al., 2003). Cultivars should be 
selected based on the local climate, resistance to local 
pests, and intended use. Consult with your local land 
gra nt university, local extension,  or local USDA NRCS 
office for recommendations on adapted cultivars for use 
in your area .
