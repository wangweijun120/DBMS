Uses  
Restoration/reclamation : 
Douglas’ dustymaiden is an early colonizer of disturbed 
sites. It is commonly found on roadsides and gravel pits 
competing against invasive species such as cheatgrass and 
knapweed species.   
It has also been found to be among the most successful 
native pioneer forb species on a broad variety of mining 
waste rock surfaces (Borden and Black, 2005).   
 
Wildlife :  Douglas’ dustymaiden can be used as part of a native forb 
component in wildland seedings to increase biodiversity, 
improve wildlife habitat, and provide food for numerous 
birds and mammals.  Douglas’ dustymaiden is readily 
visited by pollinators and other insect species. It is 
considered an important species for sage grouse during 
brood rea
ring because of its insect associations.   
 
Ethnobotanic : 
Douglas’ dustymaiden was commonly used by Native 
Americans to treat a variety of health problems. A 
poultice of Douglas’ dustymaiden was used by Native 
Americans to treat swelling, sores and aches (F oster and 
Hobbs, 2002; Moerman, 1998). A tea made from the plant 
was used to slow heart rates in children (Foster and 
Hobbs, 2002; Moerman, 1998) and for indigestion and 
headaches.  
 
Status

of Natural Re sources for this plant’s current status (e.g., 
threatened or endangered species, state noxious status, 
and wetland indicator values).  
 
Description  
General : Sunflower family (Asteraceae). Douglas’ 
dustymaiden is a biennial or short -lived perennial forb 
deve loping from a basal rosette of grayish multi -lobed  to 
lacey  leaves. Flowering stems generally reach 30 to 60 cm 
tall  (12 to 24 in) and are topped with white to pinkish 
composite flowers  (figure 1) . The fruit is a golden to 
black achene, approximately 8 mm (0.3 in) long with 10 
to 16 membranous pappus scales (Welsh et al. 2003).  
There are approximately 342,500  seeds/lb (USDA NRCS 
PLANTS Database, 2010. ).   
 
C ytogeographic stud ies have revealed  multiple ploidy 
levels present in the  Chaenactis douglasii  comple x 
(Mooring, 1980). Mooring reported chromosome counts 
of 2n=12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 37 and ca 38. 
Mooring  also noted  that diploid populations primarily 
occur in the  mountains of the  Pacific and Rocky 
Mountain  Regions, while polyploids inhab it the 
intervening plateaus. Mooring  also found ploidy level to 
be correlated with the age of geologic substrate.  
 
This species is morphologically diverse and has been 
treated by taxonomists as a single species or as up to ten 
different species with six va rieties. The PLANTS 
D atabase currently recognizes one species with two 
varieties,  douglasii and  alpina  (USDA, 20 10). 
 
Variety  douglasii  are  larger statured b iennials or 
perennials,  typically from 10 to 50 cm (4 to 20 in) tall,
