Quercus virginiana Mill. 
Plant Symbol = QUVI 
     
Common Names:  southern live oak, southeastern live oak, 
Virginia live oak, chêne vert 
      
Synonyms and other scientific names:  Quercus andromeda 
Riddell; Quercus virginiana var. eximea Sarg.; Quercus 
virginiana var. virescens Sarg.; Quercus virens Ait., nom. illeg. 
Description 
General:  Medium to large trees 50-80 ft (15-25 m) tall, with 
short trunks, long branches, and very broad crowns occasionally 
approaching 150 ft (45.7 m) wide, but with longer trunks and narrower crowns in some older woodlands, occasionally to 115 
ft (35 m) tall.  Very large, old trees can have trunks exceeding 10 ft (3 m) in diameter at breast height.  Wood can lack 
obvious or distinct growth rings, especially towards the southern part of its range (Tomlinson, 1986).  Short root suckers 
often forming near the trunk.  Bark is gray, very dark brown, to black, and scaly to blocky.  Young twigs tan to pale gray, 
covered in short hairs, becoming darker and nearly smooth in the second year.  Buds small, red-brown, rounded.  Leaves 
thickened, shiny on the upper surface, the lower surface pale with short hairs but green and without hair in shade-grown 
leaves.  Leaves 1.4-3.5 in (35-90 mm) long, 0.8-1.5 in (20-38 mm) wide, usually rounded to oblong, without teeth, but some 
summer growth and growth on juvenile trees with toothed leaves (Nelson, 1994) that can be smaller.  Leaves appear 
evergreen but actually are deciduous, with trees bare or nearly so for up to a few weeks during or just preceding flowering in 
the early spring.  Male and female flowers inconspicuous, borne separately on the same tree (typical of all oaks), female 
flowers wind-pollinated, solitary or in clusters of 2-3 or rarely up to 5, male flowers in catkins of several flowers.  Acorns 
stalked, solitary or up to five in a cluster, acorn caps 0.3-0.6 in (8-15 mm) long and wide, bowl- to goblet-shaped, with 
numerous, tiny, sharp-pointed scales, nuts barrel-shaped to egg-shaped, 0.6-1.0 in (15-25 mm) long, dark brown to black.  
Seedlings with a swollen primary root developing shortly after germination.  For detailed descriptions see Correll & 
Johnston, 1970; Miller & Lamb, 1985; Nixon & Muller, 1997; Stein et al., 2003; and Tomlinson, 1986. 
 
Hybrids:  Quercus virginiana is known, presumed, or suspected to hybridize with Q. alba, Q. bicolor (an artificial hybrid, Q. 
×nessiana Palmer), Q. lyrata (Q. ×comptoniae Sarg.), Q. macrocarpa (Q. ×burnetensis Little), Q. michauxii, Q. minima, Q. 
sinuata, and Q. stellata (Q. ×harbisonii Sarg.).  Quercus virginiana hybridizes with Q. fusiformis across of central Texas, 
leading to much confusion between these two species (Eaton et al, 2015; Jones, 1975; Nixon & Muller, 1997; B.J. Simpson, 
1988).  Quercus virginiana also occasionally may hybridize with Q. geminata (Cavender-Bares & Pahlich, 2009). 
 
Related species:  Quercus virginiana is one of seven currently-recognized species of similar oaks contained within the North 
American and Carribean Quercus L. subgenus Quercus L. section Quercus L. subsection Virentes (Loudon) A. Camus 
(section Virentes Loudon, [unranked] Virentes (Loudon) Trel.), consisting of trees or shrubs with small, rounded buds, 
leathery, nearly evergreen leaves that in mature plants usually are untoothed or sparsely toothed; acorns that develop in one 
growing season and have fused cotyledons; acorn caps with flattened, triangular scales that are darkened apically; and 
seedlings usually with swollen taproots.  Quercus subsect. Virentes is estimated to have been derived around 11 million years 
before present (Cavender-Bares et al., 2015), and is most closely related to the much more diverse and widespread white oaks 
in the remainder of Quercus sect. Quercus (Cavender-Bares et al., 2015; Hipp et al., 2014).  Other species within Quercus 
subsect. Virentes are: Q. brandegeei Goldman, a small to medium-sized tree with very elongate acorns, of lower elevations in 
mountainous areas in southernmost Baja California, Mexico (Roberts, 1989; Wiggins, 1980); Q. fusiformis Small (Quercus 
virginiana var. fusiformis (Small) Sarg.), the Texas live oak, perhaps the most cold-hardy member of Quercus subsect. 
Virentes (Cavender-Bares et al., 2015; Diggs et al., 1999), a solitary-trunked to thicket-forming, small to large-sized tree or 
rarely a shrub, bearing somewhat elongated acorns, in various soil types and rock outcrops (especially limestone and granite), 
of southwestern Oklahoma, central and southern Texas, and northeastern Mexico; Q. geminata Small (Q. virginiana var. 
geminata (Small) Sarg., Q. virginiana var. maritima (Chapm.) Sarg.), the sand live oak, a thicket-forming shrub to medium-
sized tree with leaves with revolute margins often resembling upside-down boats, of deep, dry, sandy soil in the outer coastal 
plain from Mississippi to North Carolina; Q. minima (Sarg.) Small (Q. virginiana var. minima Sarg.), the dwarf live oak, a 
Cultivated tree, Greensboro, NC.  Photographer:  Douglas Goldman

low, rhizomatous shrub forming dense colonies, and usually with toothed leaves, in somewhat moist, sandy soil, with a 
similar distribution to Q. geminata; Q. oleoides Schltdl. & Cham., a small to large-sized tree of seasonally dry subtropical 
and tropical forests from northeastern Mexico south to Costa Rica (Boucher, 1983; Jiménez et al., 2016; Kappelle, 2016); and 
Q. sagraeana Nutt. (orthographic variant Q. sagrana; Q. cubana A. Rich., Q. oleoides var. sagraeana (Nutt.) C.H. Mull., Q. 
virginiana var. sagraeana (Nutt.) Trel.), the sole Caribbean member of the genus (Trelease, 1924), a medium to large-sized 
tree of sandy to rocky soils in flat to hilly areas of western Cuba (Borhidi, 1996), which could be derived from Q. virginiana 
(Gugger & Cavender-Bares, 2013), or more likely Q. oleoides followed by introgression with Florida live oaks (Eaton et al., 
2015).  Live oaks in sandy soils of southernmost Texas may be hybrids of Q. fusiformis with Q. oleoides, and the name Q. 
oleoides var. quaterna C.H. Mull. has been used for at least some of these trees (Nixon & Muller, 1997).  For further 
information on Quercus subsect. Virentes see Camus (1939), Muller (1961) and Trelease (1924) for a detailed morphological 
summary, and Cavender-Bares et al. (2015) for phylogeny and biogeography. 
 
The largest known living specimen of Quercus virginiana is in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana (American Forests, 2016), 
with a height of only 68 ft, (20.7 m) but a crown spread of 139 ft (42.4 m) and a trunk circumference of nearly 39 ft (11.9 m).  
Because this tree has several trunks it may not be a single tree.  Close competitors are a three-trunked tree in Waycross, 
Georgia, and a single-trunked tree in Seminole County, Georgia (Georgia Forestry Commission, 2015).  The Waycross tree is 
77 ft, (23.5 m) tall, an average crown spread of 155 ft (47.2 m) and a trunk circumference of 35 ft (10.7 m).  The Seminole 
county tree is 89 ft, (27.1 m) tall, an average crown spread of 147 ft (44.8 m) and a trunk circumference of about 32 ft (9.8 
m). 
Distribution:  Live oak is native to the coastal plain of the southeastern United States, from southeastern Virginia southward 
to south Florida and west to eastern Texas (Nixon & Muller, 1997).  It is common to abundant throughout much of its natural 
range, but less so at its northeastern extremity in Virginia where it is relatively rare except along the coast near Virginia 
Beach (Weakley et al., 2012).  It is also locally naturalized in Utah (USDA NRCS, 2016).  For current distribution, please 
consult the profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
Habitat:  Warm-temperate to subtropical or marginally tropical woodlands, savannas, and grasslands, on slightly damp to 
somewhat dry clay, loam, or sand, occasionally on limestone.  Perhaps best represented in evergreen woodlands on maritime 
barrier islands, but also in various forest types in peninsular Florida, including those of floodplains, moist hammocks, and 
upland tropical hammocks on limestone (Clewell, 1985; Duever et al., 1986, ch. 5; Harms, 1990; Nixon & Muller, 1997; 
Snyder et al., 1990).  Throughout much of its range its branches are hosts to many epiphytic plants, especially bromeliads 
(such as ball moss, Tillandsia recurvata (L.) L, and Spanish moss, T. usneoides (L.) L.), ferns (typically resurrection fern, 
Pleopeltis polypodioides (L.) Andrews & Windham), and orchids. 
Adaptation 
Live oak is tolerant of a wide range of soil moisture, pH, and compaction (Dirr, 1998), and survives both significant drought 
and short periods of flooding (Allen & Kennedy, 1989; Arnold et al.. 2012 [in part for Q. fusiformis]; Carey, 1992).  Live oak 
is notably salt-tolerant (Van Arsdel, 1980), and coastal populations of live oak exhibit more leaf succulence due to frequent 
exposure to salt spray (Sinclair & Lyon, 2005).  Live oak also is tolerant of freezing weather, although more northern 
populations seem to be most tolerant of sub-freezing temperatures as well as salt (Kurtz et al., 2013), and naturally occurring 
trees from further north within its range display an innate tendency toward partial deciduousness in the winter (Cavender-
Bares, 2007).  This species also exhibits a combination of both intolerance and tolerance of fire, with the above-ground parts 
of a tree damaged or killed by even low-intensity ground fires, with smaller trees most susceptible to damage, but the root 
crown surviving and producing many suckers after a fire (Carey, 1992; Harms, 1990).  This species is native to a region 
likely to experience hurricanes, which this species withstands well (Harms, 1990), perhaps due to its very hard wood.  Live 
oaks in south Florida fully recovered within a decade after severe damage caused by Hurricane Andrew in 1992 (Douglas 
Goldman, personal observation). 
Uses 
Timber/wood:  Quercus virginiana wood is brown to nearly white (darker in heartwood than sapwood), close-grained, and is 
extremely hard, strong, and heavy (Austin, 2004; Panshin & de Zeeuw, 1970).  Dry wood has a density of around 56-63 lb/ft3 
(900 - 1009 kg/m3, 0.9-1.0 g/cm3; Alden, 1995; Cavender-Bares et al., 2004; National Hardwood Lumber Association, 2014), 
and perhaps higher (Steve Cross, personal communication, August, 2015), and a high specific gravity, around 0.8 for fresh 
wood and up to 1.00 for oven-dried wood (Alden, 1995; Jenkins et al., 2004; Meier, 2015; Panshin & de Zeeuw, 1970), 
making its wood one of the densest of North American tree species. 
 
Live oak wood has a long reputation for hardness and durability.  Nuttall (1865, pp. 29-30) found the substantial weight of 
the wood to be similar to that of lignum vitae (Guaiacum officinale L.), a tree species noted for its remarkable wood density.  
Stuart (1833, p. 94) commented that “the wood of this tree is almost incorruptible”, and Catesby (1731, p. 17) stated that the

wood was “harder and tougher than any other oak”. Consequently, it is appropriate to use for “articles requiring exceptional 
strength and toughness” (Panshin & de Zeeuw, 1970).  The wood can have a satiny surface and receive a high polish (Camus, 
1939, p. 450).  It is used for durable items like furniture and flooring (Meier, 2015), and also has been used for pulp and 
firewood (Duncan & Duncan, 1988). 
 
Live oak is best known for its use in ship construction (Loudon, 1854; Wood, 1981), especially in the 18th and 19th centuries.  
The combination of the hardness of the wood, resistance to decomposition (Meier, 2015), and the various branch and trunk 
shapes (Wood, 1981), made Q. virginiana an ideal choice for use with various robust structural elements of wooden ships 
prior to the use of steel.  The USS Constitution earned the name “Old Ironsides” when cannon balls launched by the HMS 
Guerriere in August, 1812, were observed bouncing off the Constitution’s hull, which was partly constructed of live oak 
(Wood, 1981).  Events like this only reinforced the value of live oak timber, and helped result in the establishment, in 1828, 
of the first Federally-owned and managed tree farm in the United States, the Naval Live Oaks, now part of Gulf Islands 
National seashore near Pensacola, Florida (Snell, 1983; Wood, 1981).  On occasion live oak is still used for ship construction. 
Beginning in 2011, the Maritime Museum of San Diego began constructing a replica of the Spanish galleon San Salvador, 
which in 1542 was the first European vessel to visit the west coast of what would become the United States (Maxwell, 2012).  
Live oak is still used on occasion for the construction of some smaller modern vessels, such as shrimp boats (Wood, 1981). 
 
Ornamental/landscaping:  Live oak commonly is used in horticulture within its native geographic range, and occasionally in 
areas beyond it that have similar climatic conditions.  First cultivated in 1739 (Olson, 1974), it is used in municipal plantings, 
and around commercial establishments and homes.  It is hardy in areas as cold as USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 7 (Dirr, 1998), 
even though it is native to Zones 8-10, but it is susceptible to damage from freezes that last for several days (B.J. Simpson, 
1988).  Its broad shape makes it an elegant horticultural subject, and it can grow rapidly with adequate moisture (Osorio, 
2001), especially when young.  It is tolerant of diverse soil types and some variation in soil moisture, and transplants 
relatively easily, especially when young (Dirr, 1998; Rehder, 1940).  Attempts have been made to find cold-hardy live oaks 
that will survive as far north as Boston, Massachusetts (Dosmann & Aiello, 2013).  Despite being cold-hardy beyond its 
native range, its evergreen habit can make it more susceptible to branch breakage from ice or snow accumulation (Douglas 
Goldman, personal observation). 
 
Habitat restoration:  Live oak also has been used for reforestation in areas where it is climatologically suitable.  It has been 
used for revegetating well-drained portions of bottomland hardwood areas in the lower Mississippi valley (Allen & Kennedy, 
1989), as well as coal mine sites in eastern Texas (Davies & Call, 1989). 
 
Wildlife:  The acorns of this species, and the related Q. fusiformis, are valuable forage for waterfowl, turkey, wild pigs, 
raccoons, and deer (Allen & Kennedy, 1989; Elston & Hewitt, 2010 [treated as Q. virginiana]), with this species readily 
established by animal dispersal (Osorio, 2001). 
Ethnobotany 
Historically, the swollen, tuber-like roots of live oak seedlings were fried and eaten (Nixon & Muller, 1997).  The Houma 
tribe of southeastern Louisiana used a decoction of the bark of live oak for treating dysentery (Moerman, 1986).  Catesby 
(1731, p. 17) noted that the acorns were very sweet, and that the native people usually would store them and use them to 
thicken their venison soup, and extract from them a pleasant oil similar to that of almonds.  Bartram (1791, p. 85) similarly 
noted the natives’ use of a sweet acorn oil in cooking, and also observed their roasting the fruit in hot embers, consumed like 
chestnuts.  The earliest human inhabitants of what is now northwestern Costa Rica consumed the acorns of the tropical live 
oak, Quercus oleoides (Janzen & Hallwachs, 2016) 
 
Several old live oak trees have special historical significance.  See Miller & Lamb (1985) for a list of such specimens. 
Status 
Threatened or Endangered:  This species is not listed as threatened or endangered by the Federal government, or by any state 
where it naturally occurs. 
The vague statement “today live oaks are protected for public enjoyment” (Moore, 2002; Nesom, 2003) has led to confusion 
about the protected status of Quercus virginiana.  This statement should not be interpreted to mean that this species is 
excluded from commercial forestry use wherever it occurs.  This species is protected only in public parkland, just like any 
other plant species, or protected in some communities by tree ordinances (e.g. J.D. Simpson, 2015), but outside these areas it 
is not protected and commercial forestry use can be explored. 
Wetland Indicator:  In all regions where it naturally occurs, this species is considered FACU, or a facultative upland species, 
usually not occurring in wetlands (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 2016).  However, it is considered an upland plant (UPL) in 
the Western Mountains, Valleys, and Coast region (specifically Utah), where it is an introduced species.

Weedy or Invasive:  
Live oak is not an officially designated weed in any state where it occurs. 
 
Please consult with your local NRCS Field Office, Cooperative Extension Service office, state natural resource, or state 
agriculture department regarding its status and use.  Please consult the PLANTS Web site (http://plants.usda.gov/) and your 
state’s Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state noxious 
status, and wetland indicator values). 
Planting Guidelines 
Live oaks grow rapidly when planted, provided they are given adequate water and are not root-bound in pots prior to planting 
(Osorio, 2001).  They are best transplanted when small (Dirr, 1998), and transplanting success is greatest when planted in 
raised beds in sandy soil, with root collars at the surrounding soil level but not above or below it (Bryan et al., 2011).  
Because this species forms large root systems and wide crowns with age, these factors should be considered when planting 
live oaks in areas where they could obstruct vehicular traffic or damage sidewalks (Osorio, 2001). 
Management 
Live oak that are well-established under favorable conditions or in ideal habitats are very resistant to competition from other 
plant species (Harms, 1990).  When used in habitat revegetation projects this species establishes better when inoculated with 
mycorrhizae (Davies & Call, 1990).  In areas managed for game or browsing animals, the related species, Q. fusiformis, can 
out-compete many valuable forage plant species, even though it is a valuable browse and mast species itself (Fulbright & 
Garza, 1991 [treated as Q. virginiana]).  Controlling Q. fusiformis thickets with fire only increases the density of these 
thickets (Springer et al., 1987 [as Q. virginiana]).  However, with Q. fusiformis, abundant browsing can inhibit the 
establishment of mature trees (Russell & Fowler, 1999). 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Numerous fungal diseases affect live oak.  Quercus virginiana is susceptible to oak wilt (Diggs et al. 1999; Peacock & Smith, 
2013; Sinclair & Lyon, 2005), caused by Ceratocystis fagacearum (Bretz) J. Hunt (anamorph Chalara quercina B.W. Henry; 
Thielaviopsis quercina (B.W. Henry) A.E. Paulin et al.).  The disease is spread by burrowing beetles or root grafts between 
trees.  Symptoms can occur in part or all of the tree, consisting of leaf necrosis, with larger leaf veins becoming yellow to 
bronze, and gradual branch die-back over one to a few years.  Oak wilt can be contained by removing infected trees, injection 
of systemic fungicides, or breaking root grafts by trenching (Peacock & Smith, 2013; Sinclair & Lyon, 2005).  Some diseased 
Texas live oaks, Q. fusiformis, with symptoms once attributed to persimmon wilt, a disease caused by the fungus 
Nalanthamala diospyri (Crand.) Schroers & M.J. Wingf. (Acremonium diospyri (Crand.) W. Gams; Cephalosporium diospyri 
Crand.), actually suffered from oak wilt (Lewis & Oliveria, 1979 [treated as Q. virginiana]).  A canker disease caused by 
Lasiodiplodia theobromae (Pat.) Griffon & Maubl. (Botryodiplodia theobromae Pat.; Diplodia theobromae (Pat.) W. Nowell; 
Botryosphaeria rhodina (Berk. & M.A. Curtis) Arx.; Physalospora rhodina Berk. & M.A. Curtis), a secondary pathogen, can 
kill live oaks that already are badly damaged by oak wilt (Lewis & Oliveria, 1979).  Bot canker, caused by Diplodia corticola 
A.J.L. Phillips et al. (teleomorph Botryosphaeria corticola A.J.L. Phillips et al.) and D. quercivora Linald. & A.J.L. Phillips 
(teleomorph not yet identified), causes significant branch dieback in live oak (Dreaden et al., 2014; Mullerin & Smith, 2015).  
Chrysoporthe canker, a disease typically afflicting Eucalyptus, caused by Chrysoporthe cubensis (Bruner) Gryzenh. & M.J. 
Wingf. (Cryphonectria cubensis (Bruner) Hodges; Endothia eugeniae (Nutman & F.M. Roberts) J. Reid & C. Booth), has 
been found on Q. virginiana in Florida (Sinclair & Lyon, 2005).  Chestnut blight, caused by Cryphonectria parasitica 
(Murrill) M.E. Barr (Endothia parasitica (Murrill) P.J. Anderson & H.W. Anderson), affects not only chestnut species 
(Castanea Mill.), and causes local damage to slow dieback in live oaks which can be fatal (Phelps, 1974).  Live oaks also 
experience diebacks caused by Biscogniauxia atropunctata (Schwein.) Pouzar (Hypoxylon atropunctatum (Schwein.) Cooke) 
(Van Arsdel, 1972) and Amphilogia gyrosa (Berk. & Broome) Gryzenh. et al. (Cryphonectria gyrosa (Berk. & Broome) 
Sacc. & D. Sacc.; Endothia gyrosa (Berk. & Broome) Höhn.)(Sinclair & Lyon, 2005), both which can affect several oak 
species.  Taphrina caerulescens (Desm. & Mont.) Tul. causes leaf blister, resulting in leaf deformities or some defoliation 
(Harms, 1990).  Two species of fungi are known to occur only on the dead, outer bark of Q. virginiana, specifically 
Peniophorella baculorubrensis (Gilb. & M. Blackw.) K.H. Larss. (Hyphoderma baculorubrense Gilb. & M. Blackw.) and 
Perenniporia phloiophila Gilb. & M. Blackw., resulting in little harm to the tree other than the loss of areas of the oldest, 
outermost bark, causing what is otherwise known as “smooth patch” (Gilbertson & Blackwell, 1984). 
 
The bacterium Xylella fastidiosa Wells et al. causes leaf scorch in live oak, resulting in branch die-back (McGovern & 
Hopkins, 1994). 
 
Vascular epiphytic plants, especially Tillandsia recurvata and T. usneioides, are not parasites, but when present in very large 
quantities on live oaks they can increase wind loading and shading of foliar surfaces (Coder, 2010).  A leafless, vining

parasitic plant, Cassytha filiformis L., a member of the avocado or laurel family (Lauraceae), uses the sand live oak (Q. 
geminata) as one of many hosts in Florida (Sinclair & Lyon, 2005). 
 
Live oak has a handful of significant insect pests.  Twigs often are damaged by gall formation, and although insecticides can 
control gall-forming wasps reinfestation from untreated trees makes gall inhibition more difficult (Platt Bird et al., 2013).  
The roots of live oaks can be attacked by the larvae of a large beetle, the live oak root borer, Archodontes melanopus 
(Linnaeus, 1767), resulting in deformed growth of effected trees (Harms, 1990). 
 
“Oak Decline” refers to a generalized decline in growth, vigor, and health of oak trees, potentially fatal, caused by a wide 
variety of factors, including drought, physical damage caused by construction equipment or storms, soil compaction, insects, 
and secondary pathogens.  Symptoms are slowed growth, undersized or deformed leaves, chlorosis, cankers on trunks and 
branches, and dieback of twigs and branches.  See Sinclair & Lyon (2005) for a detailed summary of Oak Decline. 
 
Competition with other species can have a negative impact on live oak establishment.  For example, the presence of the 
invasive Brazilian peppertree (Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi) significantly inhibits the establishment of live oak seedlings 
(Nickerson & Flory, 2015).  
Environmental Concerns 
The related oak, Q. fusiformis, can invade grasslands, reducing available forage for wildlife (Fulbright & Garza, 1991 [treated 
as Q. virginiana]). 
Control 
Please contact your local agricultural extension specialist or county weed specialist to learn what works best in your area and 
how to use it safely.  Always read label and safety instructions for each control method.  Trade names and control measures 
appear in this document only to provide specific information.  USDA NRCS does not guarantee or warranty the products and 
control methods named, and other products may be equally effective. 
Seeds and Plant Production 
Quercus virginiana averages 352 cleaned seeds per pound (Olson, 1974).  Propagation by seed is preferred (Dirr, 1998), and 
healthy acorns germinate rapidly and in high percentages (Olson, 1974).  Acorns don’t require vernalization, but desiccated 
or frozen acorns become inviable, and those stored unfrozen in moist peat tend to germinate but bear soil-borne fungal 
pathogens (Dirr & Heuser, 1987), so planting acorns shortly after collection is preferred.  Propagation by cuttings, especially 
from younger trees, has had some success (Dirr & Heuser, 1987), but cuttings made from root suckers have rooted at very 
high rates and in turn have produced few root suckers themselves (Niu & Wang, 2007). 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area of origin)  
Several live oak cultivars are available.  One of the most popular is High Rise (‘QVTIA’), a selection with rapid vertical 
growth which is well-suited for narrow planting spaces.  For a summary of live oak cultivars see Coder (2010) and Dirr 
(1998). 
 
Cultivars should be selected based on the local climate, resistance to local pests, and intended use. Consult with your local 
land grant university, local extension or local USDA NRCS office for recommendations on adapted cultivars for use in your 
area.
