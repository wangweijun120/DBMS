Alternate Names 
Common Alternate Names:  Golden buckwheat , Nile’s 
wild buckwheat  
 
Scientific Alternate Names:  Las Vegas buckwheat was 
recently determined to be a distinct taxon in the 
Eriogonum corymbosum  complex (Reveal 2004 ). It has 
historically been grouped in varieties aureum  (Welsh et al 
2008 ) and glutinosum  (Mrowka 2008).  
Uses  
The plants provide cover and food for small mammals, 
birds and insects.  
Status  
Las Vegas buckwheat was designated a Candidate 
Species, Priority Level 6 (non -imminent threat to a 
subspecies)  by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in 2007 
due to continued loss of habitat. In 2008 it was petitioned 
for listing and listing was determined to  be w arranted but 
precluded due to work on higher priority listing actions 
( USDI  2008 ).  It is a Bureau of Land Management Special 
Status Species in the state of Nevada and considered 
threatened by the National Park Service, Lake Mead 
National Recreation Ar ea (Mrowka 2008). 
  Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (
e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
Description  
Buckwheat family (Polygonaceae). Las Vegas buckwheat 
is a woody perennial shrub up to 1.2 m ( 4 ft) high with a n 
open  rounded profile.  The leaves are densely  elliptic to 
oblong, 0.8 to 2.5 cm ( 0.3 to 1.0 in) long and 0.4 to 0.8 
cm ( 0.16 to 0.3 in ) wide and densely hairy. The 
inflorescence is a cyme or corymb of yellow flowers 
(Holmgren et al 2012). Flowering  occurs in September 
and early October (Mrowka 2008).  
 
Distribution :    
In 2008 there were nine populations known from 15 sites, 
totaling approximately 1, 145 acres in Clark and Lincoln 
Counties, Nevada (Mrowka 2008). Populations in Kane 
and Washington Counties, Utah have recently been 
discovered (UTDNR 2012).  F or current distribution, 
please consult the Plant Profile page for this species on 
the PLANTS Web site.  
 
Habitat :   
Las Vegas buckwheat is found in sparsely vegetated 
gypsum outcroppings  in the Mojave Desert . It is 
associated with other gypsophiles (adapted to gypsum -
based soils) including Las Vegas bearpoppy ( Arctomecon 
californica ), Parry sandpaper p lant (Petalonyx parryi ), 
Palmer’s phacelia ( Phacelia palmeri), wingseed blazing 
star ( Mentzelia pterosperma) and froststem suncup 
( Camissonia multijuga)  (Mrowka 2008).  
Adaptation  
Las Vegas buckwheat is found on gypsum based soils, 
clay beds and high -boron shale soils (Mrowka 2008).   
Known populations occur between 200 and 850 m ( 650 to 
2,800  ft) elevation in areas receiving an average of 110 
mm (4.5 in) annual precipitation (Holmgr en et al 2012). 
Management  
To date, little has been done at Federal, State or County 
level to protect Las Vegas buckwheat (Mrowka 2008). 
Conservation measures are being developed to protect the 
sensitive habitat; however these are not viewed as 
sufficient  to remove the threats to the species ( USDI 
2011).   
 
Pests and Potential Problems  
The primary threat to Las Vegas buckwheat is reduction 
of habitat due to the development and urbanization in the 
Las Vegas, Nevada area. Other notable threats include

off-road  vehicle use and gypsum mining in Las Vegas 
buckwheat habitat (Mrowka 2008).  
Environmental Concerns  
Changes to habitat and precipitation due to global climate 
change have been cited as a potential threat to Las  Vegas 
buckwheat (Mrowka 2008).  
Seeds and Plant Production  
There is no available information on the propagation and 
establishment of Las Vegas buckwheat in the strict s ense. 
Meyer and Paulsen (2000) reported that seed of E. 
corymbosum  (in the broad sense ) from low elevation, 
warm sites near Moab and S aint George, Utah required 4 
weeks of cold/moist pretreatment at 2° C  (36° F)  in the 
dark, while seed from a higher elevation collection on the 
San  Rafael  Swell, Utah required 8 weeks of cold/moist 
treatment to break dormancy.
