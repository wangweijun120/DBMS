Status  
Maguire daisy ( E. maguirei  var.  maguirei ) was listed 
as endangered in 1985 (USDI -FWS, 1985 ). However, 
in 1993,  it was determined through DNA analysis 
that varieties maguirei  and  harrisonii  did not merit 
recognition as distinct species  (Van Buren, 1993). 
Following this discovery, the  now broader  E. 
maguirei  w as reclassified as threatened in 1996 
(USDI -FWS, 1996).  I n 2008, USDI -FWS proposed 
delisting of the species, citing that populations  were 
stable and the species is not currently , and is not 
likely to become an endangered species within the 
foreseeable  future (USDI- FWS, 2008). It was 
officially removed from the L ist of Endangered and 
Threatened Plants, and announced the availability of 
the final post -delisting monitoring plan in 2011 
(USDI -FWS, 2011).

Description  
General :  Sunflower family (Asteraceae). Maguire 
daisy is a perennial, herbaceous forb with spreading  to erect stems
 arising from a branching caudex . 
Mature plants reach up to 18 cm (7 in) in height. The 
lowest leaves are 2 to 5 cm (0.75 to 2 in) long and 3 
to 8 mm (0.12 to 0.31 in)  wide. The leaves become   
 
reduced going up the stem. Leaves and stems are 
covered with spreading hairs. The stems bear 1  to 3 
flowers with 12 to 20 white to pinkish rays. The 
flower centers are made of several yellow to orange 
disk flowers. The fruit is a 2 nerved, hairy achene 
with a pappus of 13 to 25 barbellate bristles (Welsh 
et al., 2003).  
Distribution :    
Maguire daisy  populations have been identified in 
Emery, Wayne and Garfield Counties in southeastern 
Utah.  The range of the species is currently estimated 
at 1,010 km² (390 mi²). (USDI -FWS, 2008).

page for this speci es on the PLANTS Web site.  
 
Habitat :  
Maguire daisy occurs on mesa tops in d warf 
mountain mahogany- slickrock plant communities in 
association with pinyon -juniper, ponderosa pine and 
slickrock pockets in mesic canyon bottoms, mountain 
shrub and intermittent  riparian communities.  All 
known populations exist between 1,500 and 2,600 m 
( 4,900 to 8,500  ft) in elevation. The species occurs 
primarily on Navajo Sandstone formations but is also 
found  on the Wingate and Chinle formations.  
Adaptation  
Maguire daisy is adapted to arid, sandy sites 
receiving 15 to 23 cm (6 to 9 in) of mean annual 
precipitation.  
Management  
According to the USDI -FWS (2008) the known 
populations of Maguire daisy were stable , and threats 
had been addressed with adequate regulatory 
mechanisms i n place.
