Uses  
Range:  
Oneflower helianthella is a valuable rangeland forb. The 
leaves ,  flowers and tender portions of the stems are eaten 
by all classes of grazing animals. Palatability of 
oneflower helianthella is rated as fair to very good for 
sheep and fair for cattle (USDA 1937). It is grazed 
primarily in summer when the vegetative tiss ues are soft, 
and less so during fall. The sturdy taproot allows it to 
withstand trampling under heavy grazing.   
 
Wildlife:  
Oneflower helianthella can be used to add diversity and 
beauty to rangeland seedings. The showy flowers are a 
pollen source for a variety of  bees including the native 
mason bee, Osmia californica  (Williams 2003).  The  plants are browsed by deer and the seed are eaten by birds 
and small mammals.
 
Status  
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status ( e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
Description  
General :  Composite family (Asteraceae).  Oneflower 
helianthella is a perennial forb with a branching root 
crown arisin g from a stout taproot. The stems are 60 to 
100 cm (2 to 3 ft) tall ending in solitary yellow flowers. 
The basal leaves are 3 to 15 cm ( 1 to 6 in) long and 0.6 to 
6 cm ( 0.25 to 2.5 in ) wide, lanceolate to elliptic with 
entire margins. The flower heads are erect with a 1.5 to 3 
cm ( 0.6 to 1.0 in) disk. Each flower head bears 13 to 17 
yellow 2 to 4 cm ( 0.75 to 1.5 in) long rays. The fruit is a 
large, flattened 6 m m ( 0.25  in) long achene with a pair of 
scaly bristles (Welsh et al 2003).  
Ethnobotany  
Oneflower  helianthella was used by the Paiute Tribe to 
make a hot poultice of mashed root to treat swellings and 
sprains (Train et al 1941). An infusion of root was also 
used by the Shoshoni as a wash or compress for 
headaches ( Train et al 1941 ). 
Distribution :  
Onef lower helianthella occurs in most western states from 
Montana south to New Mexico and west to British 
Columbia, Washington and Oregon. It does not occur in 
California or Arizona. For current distribution, please 
consult the Plant Profile page for this spec ies on the 
PLANTS Web site.  
Habitat :  Oneflower helianthella occurs on o pen 
exposures  on hill sides at low to mid elevations from 1,200 
to 3,200 m (3,900 to 10,500 ft) (Welsh et al 2003). It can 
be found in sagebrush, pinyon -juniper, mountain brush, 
ponderosa pine, aspen, and spruce- fir communities 
(Welsh et al 2003). It is commonly associated with 
arrowleaf balsamroot, Idaho fescue, mule’s ears and 
snowberry (USDA 1937) . Oneflower helianthella  rarely 
occurs  in pure stands but is often a minor component in 
t he mixed forb communities  (USDA 1937). 
Adaptation  
Oneflower  helianthella  is adapted to c oarse, shallow well 
drained soils  in areas receiving  ( 10  to 35 in)  annual 
precipitation  ( Walker and Shaw 2005) . It is not tolerant of

salinity, is moderately tolerant of shade, and has a pH 
range of 7.0 to 8.0 (USDA 2012). 
Establishment  
Oneflower helianthella can be drilled or broadcast into 
rangeland seedings (Walker and Shaw 2005). For 
optimum establishment, seed should be seeded dormant in 
late fall to a depth of 0.3  to 0.6 cm (1/8 to 1/4 in) in a 
firm, weed -free seed bed. The recommended full stand 
seeding rate for oneflower helianthella is 26 lbs/acre; for a 
seed mixture adjust the seed rate accordingly (Ogle et al 
2011).   
Management  
Oneflower helianthella  should be  used as a minor 
component of seed mixtures.  Management strategies 
should be based on the key species in the established plant 
community.  Grazing should be deferred on seeded lands 
for at least two growing seasons to allow for full stand 
establishment (O gle and others, 2011; Stevens and 
Monsen, 2004). Once established, oneflower helianthella 
is  relatively  competitive agains t weeds. 
 
Pests and Potential Problems  
There are no known potential problems or pests 
associated with oneflower helianthella.  
Environm ental Concerns  
Oneflower helianthella  is native to western North 
America. It can spread under favorable conditions but 
does not pose any environmental concern to native plant 
communities.   
 
Seeds and Plant Production  
Wildland s eed is harvested by hand  or with racquets into 
paper sacks or hoppers. The seed can be removed from 
the flower heads by light threshing or with a hammer mill. 
Air screens can be used to separate seed from chaff.  There 
are approximately 41,000 seeds/lb (USDA 2012).

Seed pretreatment recommendations for oneflower 
helianthella vary widely and may reflect differences in 
ecotypes. Link (1993) indicated that no pretreatment is  necessary for germination; however Skinner (2007) 
achieved 45% germination with no treatment and 80% 
emergence with a 45 day cold/moist stratification. 
Similarly, Bartow (2008) reported increasing germination 
rates with increased cold/moist stratification durations 
with optimum germinatio
n (98%) resulting from a 90 day 
cold/moist treatment.  
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin)  
There are no released varieties or cultivars of oneflower 
helianthella. Seed is available in limited quantities from 
commercial sources.  Seed is also available through 
contract harvesting (Walker and Shaw 2005).
