Uses  
Forage:  There is some debate regarding the toxicity o f 
the saponins in Sesbania  spp. (Powell, et al. 1990). Allen 
and Allen (1981) reported that ingestion of the plant 
poisoned cattle in Florida and Texas, and Everest et al. 
(2005) observed that ingestion of the saponins in the plant 
can result in death. How ever, Evans and Rotar (1987) 
reported  that leaflets and seeds of bigpod  sesbania were 
not toxic. They also observe that saponins are not harmful 
to ruminants when ingested. Nevertheless, all authors 
agree  Sesbania  spp. are potentially toxic, whether caused  
by saponins or a high Ca : P ratio during the reproductive 
growth stage of the plant  (Evans and Rotar, 1987) . 
Despite this plant’s potential toxicity, it is  very  palatable 
to cattle , and has good forage quality and nutritional 
value. T he seed is especially  attractive to livestock when 
there are few other food sources.  Its  vegetation contains 
31% c rude protein (Evans and Rotar , 1987) at its  vegetative stage, falling to 11.2% at its seed production 
stage (Bosworth, et al., 1980)
.   
 
Cover crop/green manure : Bi gpod  sesbania is g rown 
mainly for use as a soil -improving crop  (Duke,1983). It 
c an p roduce 2 to 3 ton /acre in 75 days and 90– 130 
lbs/acre N in above ground biomass (Wang and Nolte, 
2010).  It was once used extensively as a cover crop in 
citrus groves (Allen  and Allen,  1981) and  by cotton and 
truck crop growers in California (Evans and Rotar , 1987). 
In Sinaloa Mexico, bigpod  sesbania was found to have 
higher yield, require less weed  cultivation, and was less 
susceptible to pests than cowpea ( Vigna unguiculata) 
(Evans and Rotar, 1987).  Bigpod  sesbania tends to sprawl 
and can be supported with sorghum sudangrass when 
grown in a warm -season mixture.  Growing bigpod  
sesbania onto a support such as sorghum sudangrass will 
help the plant increase height, thereby optimizing plant 
leaf position and improving photosynthesis ( Baligar et al., 
2009) . 
 
Wildlife:  Bigpod  sesbania  a ttracts beneficial insects such 
as lady beetles  and parasitic wasps . The wasps are 
attracted to g lands that secrete sugars on the  leaf margins 
(ASI, 2013) . The seeds  persist throughout winter and 
early spring and  are  an important  food  source  for  quail, 
turkeys,  mallards, limpkins, American pintails, quail, and 
eastern mourning doves (Graham, 1941).  It is sometimes 
sown with browntop millet  (Urochloa ramosa)  in wildlife 
plantings (ASI, 2013).  
Ethnobotany  
Many species within the genus are used for fiber 
production  as a substitute for hemp. Its fiber was used by 
the Yuma Indians for production of nets and fishing line 
(Evans and Rotar, 1987) and the stems can be used for 
paper production  (Allen and Allen, 1981).  
Status  
Bigpod  sesbania  is a native  species in the Unite d States , 
but  is considered a noxious  weed in some states. Please 
consult the PLANTS Web site and your State Department 
of Natural Resources for this plant’s current status ( e.g., 
threatened or endangered species, state noxious status, 
and wetland indicato r values). 
Description  
General : Bigpod  sesbania is a s emi-woody,  native, 
perennial where it can be grown yearlong  in frost -free 
zones  or  as an  annual  warm -season  legume  where  it is 
frost -killed . It has smooth, green, tapering stems that 
become woody with  age. Although it only has a  few  
wide -spreading branches , it can grow  3 –10  ft tall.  The 
Natural Resources Conservation Service  Plant Guide

former species name  exaltata means extremely tall, and 
refers to the plant’s height.  
 
The  alternately arranged 30 cm leaves  are even -pinnately 
compound,  with approximate ly 20–70  oppositely 
arranged  leaflets . Leaflets are 0.75– 2.5 cm long, with 
smooth  margins  and a pointed tip. They are  som ewhat 
hairy or waxy underneath.  
 
There are  2 to 6 stalked, bell- shaped flowers occurring on 
a  2–8 cm elongated inflorescence growing  from the leaf 
axil (where the leaf stalk joins the stem). The flower has 
yellow or yellow -orange  petals that are streaked or 
spotted with purple. The flower tube is 3 –4 mm long and 
4 –5 mm wide. The pea- type flower’s upper petal is 1.5 
cm long, and the wing  and keel petals are shorter.  
 
Its  linear  seedpod is 10– 20 cm long and 3 –4 mm wide, 
smooth, jointed,  curved, 4 -sided, and tipped with a small 
beak.  The seedpod can contain 30 to 40 seeds.  The seeds 
are mottled with orange, green, and brown.  It can be 
s ome times confused with partridge pea  (Cassia 
fasciculata ) however;  partridge pea  has fewer (16 –30) 
leaflets per leaf.  It m ay live up to 20 years (FAO, 2007)  in 
regions where it can survive as a perennial.   
 
Distribution: 
In the United States, bigpod  sesbania  grows from  New 
York to the Southeast, and  southwest to Texas and 
California.  It is also found in Mexico and Central 
America.  Historically, it w as once  popular as a green 
manure crop in Arizona and Southern California (Evans 
and  Rotar, 1987 ). 
 
For current distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.  
 
Habitat : Bigpod  sesbania g rows in ditches, disturbed 
sites,  and along railroads,  river banks, and roadsides . It is 
commonly found in cropland, often growing in we t soils, 
sandy sites, alluvial soils along sloughs, o n the sand bars 
of streams, and in the coastal plain.  It g rows  best in areas 
with hot summers and  low humidity (Evans and Rotar, 
1987).  
Adaptation  
Generally, bigpod  sesbania is adapted to tropical and 
su btropical areas (ASI, 2013), growing  where an annual 
mean temperature is 55 –82°F  (12.5 –27.8°C). It was found 
unable to adapt to cool night temperatures in the 
Northwestern US (Evans and Rotar, 1987) and it is killed 
by frost  (ASI, 2013) . It can tolerate dr ought and grows at 
higher elevation s than crotalaria (ASI, 2013). It g rows in 
soils with a pH from 4.5 –7.2 (ASI, 2013) . It grows 
extremely well in the alluvial clay soils of the lower 
Mississippi River Valley (Bryson, 1990).  
 
  Establishment
 
The seed should be scarified before seeding and 
inoculated  with “Special Culture 1 for Sesbania” (ASI, 
2013). Plant in  full sun in late spring at 10– 25 lbs/acre, 
and sow ¾ in deep  (ASI, 2013).  The plant grows rapidly 
from  July to August. McWhorter and Anderson (1979) 
observe that 50% of the plant ’s growth occurs  between  8 
to  13 weeks after date o f planting. 
 
Bigpod s esbania can tolerate some flooding once it 
reaches seedling stage but it should not be sown in 
standing water (Evans and Rotar, 1987) as it will not 
grow in flooded conditions. It is shallow -rooted and 
requires more water than sunn hemp or cowpea  so may 
re quire irrigation until established (ASI,  2013).  It will 
remain  green until first frost.  
Management  
Traditionally bigpod  sesbania has been used in rotations 
with vegetable or grain crops. Over a 5 -year period the 
yield of a barley crop was increased by preceding it with 
bigpod  sesbania (Evans and Rotar, 1987 ). When used in 
rotations  it  is recommended to terminate bigpod  sesbania 
early, after 6 –9 weeks of growth and before seed -set to 
avoid weediness (NOFA, 2013). It can tolerate high 
mowing, and should be mo wed before incorporation into 
the soil (ASI, 2013).  Weeds should be cultivated,  as 
bigpod  sesbania does not compete well with  weeds (ASI, 
2013 ). Fields of bigpod  sesbania may be flooded to 
control weed and insect populations (Evans and Rotar, 
1987 ).  The st and can be maintained as a perennial if the 
seed is disked into the soil in the fall (Graham, 1941).  
 
Once bigpod  sesbania grows 12 cm tall, post emergent 
herbicides are ineffective for control (McWhorter and 
Ander son, 1979). Infestations of bigpod  sesbania in 
soybean fields are particularly difficult to control because 
both plants are broadleaved legumes and are sensitive to 
the same herb icides (Evans and Rotar, 1987).  
Pests and Potential Problems 
Bigpod  sesbania is i nfested by the  cowpea aphid, ba nded -
winged whitefly , and the alfalfa caterpillar. T he larvae of 
sesbania clown weevils attack roots and nodules, and 
adults defoliate the plant. Selenis monotropa  moths attack 
both this pla nt and soybean (Evans and Rotar, 1987).  
When grown in infertile so il, it can be affected by root -
knot nematodes (Graham, 1941).  
Environmental Concerns  
Bigpod  sesbania may easily become an invasive weed . It 
is a serious weed in soybean, cotton, sweet potatoes, and 
rice (Evan and Rotar, 1987).  No pre or post-emergent 
herbi cide has provided season -long control (Bryson, 
1990).  Its use in the Southwest has been discontinued 
because of its weed -like tendencies (Evan and Rotar, 
1987) . Bigpod  sesbania can grow over the tops of cash 
crops like soybean. P opulations greater than 5,5 00 
plants/ha began to reduce soybean yields (McWhorter and

Anderson, 1979). Because it tends to c olonize the banks 
of waterways and distribute seed by water, it may be 
easily spread over a large area  via watercourses . It can be 
an opportunistic plant in disturbed, less flooded, higher 
elevation sites (Meert and Hester, 2009) . Using bigpod 
sesbania as a cover before cool -season vegetable crops 
can increase sting nematode populations and reduce 
yields in subsequent crops  (ASI, 2013).  The plant does 
not contain toxic sesbanimides (Powell et al., 1990) , 
however it does contain potentially harmful levels of 
saponins.  
Seeds and Plant Production  
Bigpod s esbania flowers from March to October in 
Arizona (Evans and Rotar, 1987) o r approximately 45–50 
days after seeding (ASI, 2013).  It is rapid growing, quick 
to set seed, and will continue to produce seed over a long 
period.  Plants are self -compatible, and seed size and 
number of fruit are the same for self and out -crossed 
reproduc tion (Marshall et al., 2005). The seedpods will 
remain on the plant throughout winter but they shatter 
easily after maturity, making machine harvesting difficult  
(Evans and Rotar, 1987).  
 
The seed coat is impermeable. Approximately one -third 
of the seeds p roduced are hard seeds  (McWhorter and 
Anderson, 1979) and may not germinate  consistently  at 
time of planting . These seeds may grow  later  with 
subsequent  crops, becoming difficult to manage. Evans 
and Rotar (1987) found that 29%  of seeds survive d after 
bein g buried in the soil for 2.5 years.  Seeds have been 
found to be non -toxic (Evans and Rotar, 1987).  There are 
approximately 48,000 seeds/lb (Turner, n.d.).  Small 
amounts of seed are available through commercial 
sources.
