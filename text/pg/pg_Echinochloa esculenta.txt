Echinochloa frumentaceae L. , Echinochloa crus -galli  var. 
frumentacea  (Roxb.) Wight.  
Description  
General :  Japanese millet ( Echinochloa esculenta) is an 
introduced, annual, warm -season grass that is grown 
primarily as forage  and wildlife habitat  in the United 
States.  It is a domesticated species derived from  wild 
millet barnyardgrass ( E. crus-galli).  It is robust  with 
course , hairless  leaves  4 –20 in (10– 50 cm) long (Mitchel l, 
1989)  has a thicker stem than most millets, grows 2 –4 ft 
(60 –122 cm ) tall, with a brown to purple inflorescence. 
The re are 5 –15  racemes (stalked inflorescences) that 
curve inward, pressed closely to the main stem. The 
spikelets are awnless, slightly warty, with bristly nerves . 
It has a fibrous root system that can reach to 1 ½ ft (46 
cm)  deep (Pittman and Sweeney, 1983).   
  Japanese millet is sometimes confused with barnyard 
grass (
E. crus -galli) , but has a compact inflorescence  with 
reddish -p urple seed  with no awns,  while barnyard grass 
has an open- branched panicle and  white seeds with 
conspicuous awns.   
 
Distribution :  Japanese millet is thought to have been 
domesticated  from barnyard grass ( E. crus-galli)  in 
eastern Asia and is sometimes referred to as billion -dollar 
grass ( E. frumentacea ). Billion -dollar grass is an 
introduced species in the United States thought to have 
originated in tropical s outhern Asia (Yabuno, 1987).  It 
can be gro wn throughout the United States, and its range 
extends from Canada to northern Mexico (Mitchell, 
1989) . For current distribution, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.  
 
Habitat :  Japanese millet can occur in wetlands and non -
wetland  sites depending on the region  where it is found. It 
can be found along rivers and ponds, is abundant in 
freshwater  marshes, and can be a weed in rice fields 
( Anitha, 2013).  It does not grow well on sandy soils 
(Curran and Lingenfelter, 2012).   
Adaptation  
Ja panese millet can grow in flooded soils and standing 
water (Hancock Seed Co., 2013) as long as a portion of 
the plant remains above the water’s surface (Surrency and 
Owsley, 2006).  It  is better suited for colder climates and 
wetter soils than  other annual summer grasses such as 
sorghum  ( Sorghum bicolor ), browntop millet ( Urochloa 
ramosa ), and corn ( Zea mays) ( Curran and Lingenfelter, 
2012;  Mitchell, 1989);  however it has limited frost 
tolerance and will winter kill (Marr et al., 1998). It can 
grow at low and medium altitudes (Farrell, 2011). It  is 
adapted to soils with pH as low as 4.5 and salinity of 
2,000 –3,000  parts per million (Farrell, 2011 ; Mitchell, 
1989 ), but grows best in  sandy–clay loams (FAO, 2014)  
with pH values from 4.6 –7.4 (Mitchell, 1989).  
Uses  
Forage /Feed:   Japanese millet is  often grown  as forage in 
the United States. It can produce  up to  3 ,500  lb/ac  of 
dried  above ground biomass (Creamer and Baldwin, 
1999).  The straw has greater protein and calcium content 
than rice, oat, and timothy  (Yabuno, 1987) . 
Cover crop/green manure : 
Japanese millet is a weed -suppressing cover crop that can 
grow up to 4 ft in 45 days (Curran and Linge nfelter, 
2012).  It is considered a good smother crop and has been 
shown to reduce the dry weight and the  number of plants 
of yellow nutsedge ( Cyperus esculentus) through root 
competition for nutrients and water (Thullen and Keeley, 
1980) . It is a good N sc avenger and can be used as a fast -

growing catch-crop.  When Japanese millet is combined 
with cowpea, it can provide good weed suppression and 
improve the N fixation of cowpea (Brainard et al., 2008) ; 
however, it may be too aggressive to be beneficial in  most 
mixes (Marr et al., 1998). It is not recommended for aerial 
seeding.  It has a C:N ratio of 42 and can add 35 lb/ac N in 
aboveground biomass (Creamer and Baldwin, 1999).  
 
Wildlife:   Japanese millet is most often planted in the 
United States as  feed  for waterfowl  (Mitchell, 1989).  The 
seed produced by Japanese millet is a preferred food 
source for ducks, doves, and tu rkeys (Stewart and West, 
2004)  and is also a fair food source of pheasant (Mitchell, 
1989) . It  can be planted around the edge of ponds and 
impoundment s to provide good hunting habitat  in 
shallow -water areas . For duck habitat, it is interplanted 
with corn to add diet ary diversity near flooded areas 
(Stewart and West, 2004).  It is also eaten by a number of 
songbirds such as sparrows, finches, and cardinal s 
(Farrell, 2011). For a comprehensive list of bird species 
see Mitchell (1989).   
 
Critical Area Planting :  Japanese millet’s fast growth and 
fibrous root system makes it a good plant for controlling 
erosion  (Marr et al., 1998) . It has been shown to increase 
the  bearing capacity in  waste clay settling ponds produced 
by mining activities (Pittman and Sweeney, 1983).  
Ethnobotany  
Japanese millet was o nce grown as a staple food crop in 
Japan in regions where rice could not be cultivated, or as 
an emergency/subsistence crop when rice harvests failed 
(Yabuno, 1987).  The grain contains twice the protein 
content of regular milled white  rice (Yabuno, 1987). The 
seed is gluten- free.  
 
Status  
Weedy or Invasive
:   Japanese millet  has the ability to 
be com e weedy , often reestablishing itself in fields were it 
has been previously grown (Harper, 2009)  and/or 
escaping to roadsides, ditches, and waste places (Mitchell, 
1989) . It produces a large amount of seed that can easily 
scatter and germinate (FAO, 2014). Because it is a 
popular seed for waterfowl food plots, it may also  be 
transported through bird activity  and migration.  It can be 
problematic in some rice field s.  Please consult with your 
local NRCS Field Office, Cooperative Extension Service 
office, state natural resource, or state agriculture 
department regarding its status and use . 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site 
( http://plants.usda.gov/
)  and your State Department of 
Natural Resources for this plant’s current status (e.g., 
threatened or endangered species, state noxious status, 
and wetland indicator values).  
Planting Guidelines 
Japanese millet  can be successfully seeded into duck field 
impoundments, drained marshland, pond and lake edges, 
b ottomland stands, and beaver ponds (Mitchell, 1989). It  should be seeded in full sun 
from mid -June  in the 
Northeast to J uly–August in the Southeast , at 20– 25 lb/ac, 
¼ –½ in deep (Curran and Lingenfelter, 2012)  or 8 –12 
lb/ac in a mix . In some  warmer regions it may be planted 
as early as April (Baldwin and Creamer, 2009). It can be 
broadcast at 20 lb/ac and covered lightly ¼ in deep for 
wildlife food planting (Stewart and West, 2004) or 
direct ly seeded into mud flats or well -prepared fields. If 
there is co ncern about smothering native species when 
reseeding meadows, a lower seeding rate of 10 lb/ac 
should be used (Ernst Seed, 2013).  Moist soil is r equired 
for optimum germination. In flooded fields, seeds should 
be first pretreated by soaking overnight to en sure the seed 
sinks during seeding (Mitchell, 1989) . Typically, stands 
require no soil amendments.   
Management  
Japanese millet grows  best in full stands  without 
companion plants (Stewart and West, 2004).  It can 
tolerate frequent cuttings (Marr et al., 1998) but should be 
allowed to at least reach 20 in before cutting (Pritts and 
Nonnecke, 2005). It  can be terminated by mowing or 
undercutting (Creamer and Baldwin, 1999) , and will not 
survive fire (FAO, 2014 ).  For waterfowl food planting in 
the Southeast, plant in late summer  when  the soil is dry 
enough to plant and flood two weeks before duck season 
(Stewart and West, 2004).  Water control structures may 
be used to dewater sites in either late spring or summer 
and to flood the site again before fall migration (Mitchell, 
1989). Water drawdown in spring however should not 
interfere with spring waterfowl migration or late -season  
wood duck hatching . 
Pests and Potential Problems  
Japanese millet may be  a host for root knot nematodes 
(Radovich, 2010).  
Environmental Concerns  
Seeds and Plant Production  
Seeds  can reach maturity in 50 –60 days (Stewart and 
West, 2004) , but most varieties will mature in 80 –90 days 
(Surrency and Owsley, 2006).  It will produce 
approximatel y 1,500– 2,000 lb/ac seed (Mitchell, 1989) 
with  142,900 seeds/ lb ( Advance Cover Crops, 2013) . 
Many seeds will remain on the seedhead into January 
(Mitchell, 1989).   
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin)   
Yabuno (1987) reports that there are 120 cultivars of 
Japanese millet grown at the Tohoku Agricultural 
Experiment Station, Japan. Japanese millet  ‘Chiwapa’ is a 
cultivar developed by the USDA -NRCS Mississippi Plant 
Materials Center in 1965. Japanese millet  is readily 
available from a variety of commercial seed dealers. 
Cultivars should be selected based on the local climate, 
resistance to local pests, and intended use. Consult with 
your local land grant university, local extension or local 
USDA NRCS office for recommendations on adapted 
cultivars for use in your area .
