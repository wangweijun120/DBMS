Uses  
Livestock:  Buffalograss is primarily used for range 
grazing and is important component  of the shortgrass and 
mixed grass prairies. (Leithead et al. 1971 and Howard, 
1995).  Buffalograss  is utilized by all classes of livestock . 
It  is considered good  quality forage, and nutritional  
qualities do not decline significantly during curing 
(Hitchcock , 1951). 
 
Wildlife : Buffalograss is consumed by several species of 
prairie animals including the white tailed deer, bison, and 
prairie dogs ( Chamrad and Box, 1968; Clippinger, 1989; 
Duble, 2012.   This plant is a larval host for the Green 
Skipper (Ladybird Johnson Wildflower Center, 2013). 
Grasshoppers including the White whiskered grasshopper , 
Red winged grasshopper, Carolina grasshopper, 
Slantfaced Pasture grasshopper, Large headed 
grasshopper, and Mottled Sand grasshopper feed on 
buffalograss foliage  (Illinois Wildflowers, 2012).                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
 
Landscaping: Buffalograss is growing in popularity for 
use in  low traffic areas and a possible substitute for 
nonnative  warm season  grasses such as bermudagrass  
( Cynodon dactylon) , St. Augustine ( Stenotaphrum   
secundatum ), and zoysia  ( Zoysia japonica ) (Huang, 1999  and Mintenko et al., 2002). Johnson et al. (2000) noted 
that buffalograss has a slower growth rate
 than other 
commercially available non -native turfgrasses. Biran et al. 
(1981) observed that sparse, tall growing ,  warm se ason 
grasses tend to have high evapotranspiration (ET) rates 
while shorter, denser grass es had low ET rates.  Beard and 
Kim (1989) and Kim
 (1983) noted lower ET  and slower 
growth rates of buffalograss  compared  to common  
bermudagrass ( C. dactylon) under uniform and optimum 
growing conditions.   In another study by Kim and Beard 
( 1988), of eleven warm season and cool season 
turfgrasses, buffalograss showed the lowest average ET  
rate of 4.8 mmd
-1.   A study  in Texas  of native and non-
native grasses , buffalograss  ( B. dactyloides ) demonstrated 
higher survivability (85 -98%) than bermudag rass (C. 
dactylon) (5 -35%) after 3 years  ( McAfee and Leps , 2001). 
   
Erosion Control : Buffalograss forms a dense sod that 
impedes soil erosion. The plants develop numerous fine 
roots that are tough and wiry ; penetrat ing into the soil 4 to 
6 feet. In a study  conducted on Holdrege silt loam and 
Chernozem Wabash silt loam, approximately 70% (by 
weight) of the roots of buffalograss plants were in the first 
6 inches of the soil profile (Weaver, 1958).  
 
Status  
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Depa rtment of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status ( e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
Description  
General : Buffalograss is a native ,  warm season , 
stoloniferous  perennial  that grows  4 to 6 inches in height. 
The leaf blade is 1/8 inch wide and 3 to 6 inches long. 
The ligule is a row of short hair.  The  plant is dioecious . 
Both  sexes  have a spike for the seed head. The female 
flowers are burs partially hidden among the leaves and the 
male flow ers have 2 or 3 short spikes on slender, erect 
stems (Leithead et al. , 1971).  
 
Distribution :    It is found from western Minnesota to 
Montana and then S outh to Arizona and eastward to 
Louisiana (Hitchcock, 1951).
   For current distribution, 
please consult the Plant Profile page for this species on 
the PLANTS Web site.  
 
Habitat : Buffalograss is found on clay soils in moderate 
to low rainfall areas (15 to 30 inches annually)  (Duble,  
2012) and tolerates alkaline soils (University of 
Wyoming, 2013) .

Adaptation  
Buffalograss is found on dry prairies on medium to fine 
textured soils (Hatch, 1995). It is prevalent in the short 
grass prairie region of the Great Plains  uplands  
(Hitchcock, 1951).  
 
Establishment  
Buffalograss can be established by direct  seeding or  via 
vegetative plugs and  sod.   Soil analysis should be 
performed prior to planting to determine the necessary 
levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. When 
planting seed, nitrogen should not be applied until the 
stand is established.  
 
Seedbed preparation  should begin well in advance of 
planting in the spring. Establish a clean, weed free 
seedbed by either tillage or herbicides. Prior to planting, 
the soil should be firm and have accumulated  adequate 
soil moisture.  
 
 
  S eed  
Seed should be planted with a grain drill  equipped with a 
native seed box  and planted to a depth of ½ inch.  If 
broadcast  planting , the seeding rate should be increased , 
and some form of drag should be used after broadcasting 
to cover the seed, provide good seed -to -soil contact, and 
co nserve soil moisture.   
 
For pasture , rangeland  and wildlife plantings, seeding 
rates for a monoculture stand range from 8 to 26 pound s 
per live seed  per acre  (USDA / Texas  Natural Resources 
Conservation Service , 2001; Boltz , 2012)  depending upon 
the inten ded use of  the planting.  Buffalograss contains 
approximately 50,000 seed per pound. When  planting 
mixtures , the seeding rate may be proportionately 
adjusted  based on the desired amount of buffalograss in 
the planting.  Please consult your local Natural Resources 
Conservation Service Field Office before beginning 
preparation and planting.  
 
For lawn/residential planting :   When  broadcasting seed, 
u se a seeding rate of 3 to 5 pounds  per  1,000  ft
2. After 
planting, water to p revent drying of the soil surface. 
Emergence of grass seedlings should occur in 7 to 21 days 
after planting (Koski, 2012).  
 
Vegetative  
Transplanted plugs can spread  within 8 to 12 weeks after 
planting. Transplant the plugs on 12” x 18” centers after 
the la st spring frost or 6 or more weeks before the first fall 
frost. At planting, apply one pound of nitrogen (starter 
type fertilizer) per 1,000 ft
2  and a second application 6 to 
7 weeks afterward. Water the plugs  to maintain a moist 
soil surface for 7 to
 10 days to aid in establishment and 
subsequent  growth. A preemergent herbicide can be 
applied  before or just after planting  to reduce weed 
competition. The plugs may turn brown and enter  dormancy after transplanting
 because of moist stress. 
Keep the plugs mois tened until the roots become well 
established ( Koski, 2012).  
 
Sodding a lawn provides  the  most rapid cover. However, 
proper site preparation is important for a successful 
establishment. Use healthy, moist sod strips during 
installation. Afterwards, water the sod to maintain good 
soil moisture, but not saturated (K oski, 2012). 
Management  
Newly planted buff alograss pasture should not be grazed 
the first season (Wenger, 1943). After the stand is 
established, rotational or conservative continuous grazing 
can be used.  Buffalograss grows close to the ground so 
grazing animals normally harvest less than 50% of t he 
current year’s growth (Leithead et al., 1971). Rotational 
grazing  allows the plants to recover well after grazing  
event s and store up nutrients for the winter.   Consult your 
local Natural Resources Conservation Service for 
assistance in developing and i mplementing a prescribed 
grazing plan.  
 
  Established  lawns should be fertiliz ed with  1  to  2 pound s 
of nitrogen per 1,000  ft
2 in late spring  with a follow up 
application  in July  (Dunn and Ervin, 2001) . Over 
fertilization (more than 2 pounds per 1,000 ft
2  pe r year) 
does not help the lawn  and with excessive watering can  
increase weed competition . Buffalograss lawns need one 
to two inches of water every two to four weeks during the 
summer to maintain active growth  (Koski, 2012) .  If the 
lawn is stressed by drought, it will become dormant and 
wait for favorable growing conditions  (Dunn and Ervin, 
2001) .    
 
Pests and Potential Problems  
In seed production, false smut may develop in late spring 
(Wenger, 1943).  Mealybugs  and chinch bug have been 
found in Nebrask a buffalograss lawns (Koski, 2012).  
 
Control  
Please contact your local agricultural extension specialist 
or county weed specialist to learn what works best in your 
area and how to use it safely.  Always read label and 
safety instructions for each control  method 
Seeds and Plant Production  
Seed can be produced under irrigation or dryland 
conditions. Using irrigation is  the most reliable method of 
producing seed. Dryland fields are generally the most 
productive from the second to the fifth year, after which 
t he stand begins to decline in vigor and seed yield. Seed 
production fields planted on 30” centers will usually 
spread together during the first year and begin producing 
seed in the second season (Wenger, 1943).

Seed is combine  harvested with a  modified  reel head that 
us es flailing bats or brooms to push the harvested material 
into the combine. Slow (< 5 mph) travel is recommended 
while harvesting. When harvesting material for both seed 
and forage, production fields may need to be harvested a 
second time to gather burs which were immature at the 
first harvest when the grass was green (40 to 50 percent 
mo isture) (Wenger, 1943).  
 
Cornelius (1950) reported an average seed yield of 216 
lb /acre (60 lb  / acre rate of nitrogen and dryland 
conditions)  in eastern Kansas . S eed yields of irrigated 
stands averaged 300- 1,000 lb /acre  (Wenger, 1943; Atkins 
and Smith 1967) . Atkins and Smith (1967) noted seed fill 
of 90% and average germination of 45%.  In a study by 
Abeyo et al. (2006), nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer 
applications increased seed yields of ‘Bowie’ 
buffalograss.   
 
 
The caryopsis of buffalograss is enclos ed in a rigid, tight 
cluster of spikelets and glumes known as a bur. The bur 
seems to impede caryopsis germination. Ahring and Todd 
(1977) found that prechilling seed at 5
o  to 10o C for 6 to 8 
weeks or soaking seed burs in 5.25% sodium hypochlorite 
for 72 hours overcame the effect of the bur on seed 
dormancy.  
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin)  
Some seed cultivars include Bison, Cody, Sharps 
Improved, Tatanka, Texoka, Topgun, and Plains (Dunn 
and Ervin, 2001) . Some vegetative cultivars include 
Bonniebrae, Legacy, Midget, Mobuff, 
Stampede,’315,’378’, and ‘609’ (Dunn and Ervin, 2001)
