Uses  
Landscaping  
Showy goldeneye produces abundant flowers and is easy 
to manage in landscaped settings. It has been used in 
mixed borders and  meadow gardens. 
 
Wildlife  
Showy  goldeneye attracts a variety of native bees , 
butterflies and hummingbirds ( Lady Bird Johnson 
Wildflower Center  2012) . Cockerell (1919) reported 
several native bee species visit ing showy goldeneye in 
Peaceful Valley, Colorado including Halictus cressonii , 
Panurginus porterae , and Halictoides oryx .  
 
Showy goldeneye also provides food for larger animals. 
Cattle,  sheep, deer and elk eat leaves and flower heads 
( Kufeld 1973 ). Birds and small rodents eat  the seed. 
 
Range  
Showy  goldeneye  c an be used for restoration of native 
plant  communities.  It is competitive against other species 
and d oes w ell when planted in a mixture (Stevens et al  1981
). It w ill spread by seed  into open areas and  areas 
occupied by annuals  ( Stevens and Monsen 2004).   
Status  
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plantâ€™s current 
status ( e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indic ator values). 
Description  
General :  Composite family (Asteraceae).  Showy 
goldeneye is a perennial forb arising from a woody 
taproot. The much branching stems reach approximately 1 
m ( 39 in) in height. Leaves are lanceolate to linear, 
opposite, entire or serrate, 1 to 8 cm ( 0.4 to 3.2 in) long 
and 2 to 20 mm ( 0.08 to 0.8 in) wide. There are 
commonly 2 to several flower heads per stem . The disk is 
6 to 14 mm (0.25 to 0.6 in) across with dark yellow 
flowers. The disk is surrounded by 10 to 14 yellow ray 
flow ers, 7 to 18 mm ( 0.3 to 0.7 in) long. The fruit is a 
brown achene 1.2 to 1.8 mm ( 0.05 to 0.07 in) long lacking 
a pappus (Welsh et al 2003).   There are approximately 
1,000,000 seeds per pound in pure seed.  
Ethnobotany  
Showy goldeneye  had  limited use by Native Americans. 
The seed was used for food by the Goshute Tribe  
(Chamberlin 1911).   Navajo grazed sheep on showy 
goldeneye  (Vestal 1952).  
Distribution :  
Showy goldeneye is found in most western states from 
Texas north to Montana and west to California, Nevada 
and Idaho. For current distribution, please consult the 
Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site.  
 
Habitat :   
Showy goldeneye occurs in sagebrush, juniper, 
cottonwood, aspen, and spruce fir communities from 
1,350 to 3,000 m ( 4,430 to 9,840 ft).  
Adaptation  
This species prefers areas with f ull sun in well drained 
loam to loamy sand soils. It is found in sites receiving 
approximately  457 to 635 mm  (18 to 25 in) of annual 
precipitation. It is recommended for use in USDA  Plant 
Hardiness Z ones 4b to 10a (EverWildeFarms 2012) . 
Establishment  
Showy goldeneye can be drilled or broadcast into 
rangeland seedings (Walker and Shaw 2005). For 
optimum establishment, seed should be dormant  seeded in 
late fall to a depth of 0.3 to 0.6 cm (1/8 to 1/4 in) in a

firm, weed-free seed bed. The recommended full stand 
seeding rate for showy goldeneye is 2 lbs/acre; for a seed 
mixture adjust the seed rate accordingly (Ogle et al 2011). 
This species ha s good seedling vigor ( Stevens and 
Monsen  2004) which  makes it a useful component in seed 
mix tures . 
Management  
Showy goldeneye  should be  used as a minor component 
of seed mixtures.  Management strategies should be based 
on the key species in the establishe d plant community.  
Grazing should be deferred on seeded lands for at least 
two growing seasons to allow for full stand establishment 
(Ogl e et al.  2011; Stevens and Monsen 2004).   
 
Pests and Potential Problems  
Showy goldeneye can accumulate nitrate when gr owing 
in areas with high levels of nitrogen from fertilizers or 
animal excrement (Williams 1989). Animals suffering 
from nitrate intoxication will show labored respiration, 
trembling, weakness and collapse. Death occurs in less 
than an hour (Burrows and Tyrl 2001).  
Environmental Concerns  
Showy goldeneye  is native to western North America. It 
can spread under favorable conditions but does not pose 
any environmental concern to native plant communities.   
 
Seeds and Plant Production  
Seed  is collected by hand, beating or strip ping in wildland 
situations  (Stevens and Monsen 2004).  Seed remains 
v iable for up to 7 years in warehouse conditions without a 
significant loss of viability ( Stevens and Jorgensen 1994). 
Showy goldeneye produces large quantities of flowers 
and will set s eed in the first year of growth. Seed of 
showy goldeneye is dormant and has a pre -chilling 
requirement for germination.  
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin)  
Seed of showy goldeneye is available in limited quantitie s 
on the commercial market. Larger quantities of seed can 
be grown on a contract basis (Walker and Shaw 2005).
