Uses  
Wildlife  
Gray’s  biscuitroot is  grazed  by deer, sheep, mice, 
rats, and rabbits (COSEWIC, 2008). Ogle and Brazee 
(2009) rate it as desirable spring and summer forage 
for cattle, sheep, horses, elk, deer and antelope.  
 
Gray’s  biscuitroot is  one of the first species to green 
up and flower after snowmelt. This characteristic 
makes  this an important species for early spring 
pollinators and other insects. Known pollinators 
include solitary bees and flies.  
 
This species has been identified as an i mportant plant 
species in sage -grouse habitat because of its early   
   
growth habit and the
 associated insects that provide a 
critical food source for sage -grouse chicks.  
 
Gray’s  biscuitroot  is a host plant for the rare Indra 
swallowtail b utterfly (Papilio indra) and is one of 
two plants used as a host by  the Anise Swallowtail 
( Papilio zelicaon ) (Thompson 1989).  
 
Ethnobotanic  
The tender young stems and roots of Gray’s 
biscuitroot were eaten by the Paiute Indians ( Mahar, 
1953).  
 
Medicinal  
Though not proven in clinical trials, this species may 
possess  antiviral and antibacterial properties based on  
its relationship to fernleaf biscuitroot ( L. dissectum) 
(COSEWIC, 2008 ). 
 
Status

Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s

Description  
General : Carrot family (Apiaceae). Gray’s 
biscuitroot is a large, perennial, aromatic herb with a 
branched caudex arising from a deep taproot. Mature 
plants can reach up to 60 cm ( 24 in) tall. The leaves 
are finely d ivided and parsley like. Each plant bears 
up to 20 naked stems (scapes) which end in an umbel 
with several hundred male or hermaphroditic flowers 
(Thompson, 1984). The petals and stamens are 
yellow, but quickly dry to a whitish color after 
anthesis (Welsh et al., 2003).  This species also has a 
distinctive pungent odor.  
 
The seeds are approximately 12 mm ( 0.5 in) long 
with  broad lateral wings . The lateral wings are 
approximately 2  mm (0.08  in) wide and comprise up 
to 2/3 the width of the fruit body  (Welsh et  al., 2003). 
There are approximately  86,000 seeds/kg (39,000 
seeds/lb) (Barner, 2008).  
 
Plants leaf out in early spring, flower quickly , set 
seed , and then enter summer dormancy. Umbels can 
contain male or hermaphroditic flowers (Thompson , 
1987 ). Individua l plants  often do not flower in  
consecutive years (Thompson and Moody, 1985), and 
there can be considerable variatio n in the number of
