Uses  
S age -grouse ( Centrocercus uroph asianus) hens and 
chicks  eat the leaves of Agoseris  species (Barnett and 
Crawford  1994; Klebenow  and Gray 1968).   
 
Bigflower agoseris has been investigated for potential use 
in rangeland restoration and rehabilitation seedings . Large 
scale seed production including seed harvesting however 
is problematic.  
Status   Please consult the PLANTS Web site and 
your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plantâ€™s current 
status ( e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
Description  
General :  Sunflower  family (Asteraceae). Bigflower 
agoseris is a short live d perennial forb from a simple or 
branched  taproot. The stems and leaves contain a white 
milky juice. The leaves are all basal with the flower heads 
solitary on a naked scape. Leaves are 8 to 25 cm ( 3 to 10 
in) long and 1 to 3 cm ( 0.4 to 1.2 in) wide, obla nceolate 
pinnatifid to nearly entire. The flowering stems are 15 to 
45 cm ( 6 to 18 in) tall (Welsh et al. 2003). The floral 
heads are made of numerous yellow ray flowers (similar 
to a dandelion). Flowering occurs  in spring. The fruit is   
an achene with a 4  to 7 mm ( 0.16 to 0.28  in) long body  
gradually tapering into a long beak which averages more 
than twice as long as the body. There are approximately 
274,000 seeds/lb ( USDA NRCS 2012 ).   
Distribution :    
Bigflower agoseris occurs in western North America fro m 
British Columbia south to California and east to Montana 
and Utah. For current distribution, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.  
 
Habitat :   
Bigflower agoseris  is found in small numbers in 
grassland, sagebrush and mountain brush communities 
below 2,000 m (6,500 ft) (Hickman 1993; Welsh et al. 
2003).  
 
Adaptation  
This species is adapted to a broad range of soil types. It 
typically occurs in soils with a pH  of 5.8-7.3 in areas 
receiving 300 to 500 mm ( 12 to 20  in) mean annual 
precipitation  (USDA NRCS 2012 ). Big flower agoseris 
prefers open sun.  
 
Establishment  
Bigflower agoseris can be seeded in spring or fall 
(Skinner , 2004). It should be planted into a firm, weed -
f ree seed bed  at a depth of 1/8 to 1/4 inches . The 
recommended full stand seeding rate is 4 lbs pure live 
seed (PLS) per acre (Ogle et al. 2011). Seeding rates 
should be adjusted accordingly when used as part of a 
mixture.  
 
Management  
Bigflower agoseris  should be used as a minor component 
of seed mixtures.  Management strategies should be based 
on the key species in the established plant community.

Grazing should be deferred on seeded lands for at least 
two growing seasons to allow for full stand establishment 
(Ogle et al.  2011).  
Pests and Potential Problems  
Rodents such as gophers and voles will attack the roots of 
bigflower agoseris in seed production fields (Skinner 
2004) . 
Environmental Concerns  
Bigflower agoseris  is native to western North America 
and poses  no known environmental concerns.  
Seeds and Plant Production  
Seed is collected in midsummer from early June through 
late July. The seed is dark brown to black when mature 
and the pappus is white and expanded. Th e pappus can be 
removed with a hammer mill or brush machine, but 
pappus removal is not necessary for greenhouse 
propagation  (Skinner 2004; Young 2001) . 
 
Bigflower agoseris has no pre -chill requirement. Seed 
germinates approximately 14 days after sowing (Yo ung 
2001). Container grown p lants are ready for out-planting 
after approximately 60 days (Skinner 2004).  
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin)  
Seed of bigflower agoseris  is available in limited 
quantities on the commercial market . Larger quantities of 
seed may be grown on a contract basis.
