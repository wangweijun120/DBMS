Uses  
There are no known human  uses of Goose Creek 
milkvetch.  Grazing by rabbits has been observed.  
Status  
The USDI Fish and Wildlife Service  determined in 
2007 that Goose Creek milkvetch  might be warranted 
for listing as threatened or endangered and began a 
status review of  the  species. In 2009, following a 
thorough review, USDI -FWS found t hat listing was 
warranted, however listing was precluded by higher 
priority actions (USDI -FWS, 2009).  In 2010 the 
species was officially added to the candidate species 
list and was assigned a Listing Priority Number 
(LPN) of 5 due to high magnitude, yet no n-imminent 
threats (USDI -FWS, 2010).

Description
 
General : Legume  family ( Fabaceae).  Goose Creek 
milkvetch is a mat -forming perennial forb arising 
from a narrow taproot. The stems are 3 to 11 cm ( 1.2 
to 4.3 in) long and lay prostrate on the ground. The 
leaves are pinnately compound with 5 to 15 wooly 
tomentose leafl ets. Each leaflet is 3 to 7 mm ( 0.12 to 
0. 28  in) long and oval in shape. The flowers are 9 to 
11 mm ( 0.35 to 0.43  in) long, pinkish purple and 
borne in clusters of 3 to 7 flowers per stem. The fruit 
is a claw shaped pod, 9 to 12 mm ( 0.35 to 0.47 in) 
long and 5 to 7 mm ( 0.20 to 0.28 in) wide, with 16  to 
20 ovules (Welsh et al., 2003).  
 
Distribution : 
Goose Creek milkvetch occupies an area 
approximately 32.5 km (20 mi) long and 6.4 km (4 
mi) wide where  the Idaho, Nevada, and Utah border s 
meet . Known populations occur in the Goose Creek 
drainage in Ca ssia County, Idaho; Elko County, 
Nevada;  and Box Elder County, Utah  (USDI-FWS, 
2009). There were an estimated 60,000 plants  prior to 
2007  when wildfires burned much of the known 
habitat.  Accurate counts of Goose Creek milkvetch 
are  complicated due to variability in annual 
abundance.  
 
For current distribution, consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.  
 
Habitat :  
Goose Creek milkvetch occurs from 1,500 to 1,790 m 
( 4,920 to 5,870  ft) elevation in sagebrush steppe plant 
communities. It can be found growing in association 
with Wyoming big sagebrush  (Artemisia  tridentata  
ssp.  wyomingensis ), Utah juniper ( Juniperus 
osteosperma ), green rabbitbrush ( Chrysothamnus 
viscidiflorus ), Sandberg bluegrass ( Poa secunda), and 
needleand thread  (Heterostipa comata).   
 
Adaptation  
Goose Creek milkvetch grows primarily on 
tuffaceous  ( a rock composed of the finer kinds of 
volcanic detritus usually fused together by heat) 
outcrops of the Salt Lake Formation in silty to 
gravelly sandy loam soils.  The region of the Goose 
Creek drainage receives 23 to 30 cm ( 9 to 12 in) of 
annual precipitation (USDI -FWS, 2010).  
 
Management  
Management and protection of this species should be 
centered on habitat protection, especially against
