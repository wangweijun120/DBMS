Description  
General:  The rosette of yellow star -thistle  lies close 
to the ground (see Figure 2) and produces six to 28 
deeply lobed leaves that range from one to eight 
inches  (2.5 to 20 centimeters)  long and are generally 
less than two inches (5 cent imeters) wide . The rigidly 
branched, winged flowering stems  (see Figure 2) 
average about two feet (60 centimeters) tall , but 
range from four inches (10 centimeters) to five feet 
(1.5 meters), depending on environmental conditions . 
The stem leaves are entir e without lobes, linear in 
shape, and are vested with woolly hairs that persist 
through the growing season.  Flower heads are 
solitary  on the ends of short stems and have many 
bright yellow flowers  (see Figure1) . The bracts of the 
flower  heads are armed with stout, straw -colored 
spines one to two inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) long 
that radiate from the flower  head in a star shape.
