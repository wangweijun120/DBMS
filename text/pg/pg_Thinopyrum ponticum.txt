Uses 
Grazing/pasture/hayland:  Tall wheatgrass is used for 
hay and pasture in the northern Great Plains and  intermountain region.  It produces high yields of 
good quality forage, however it is typically less 
palatable than other wheatgrasses.  It is best suited 
for early season rotational grazing. 
 
Erosion control
: Tall wheatgrass is often used for 
erosion control along roadsides and other critical 
areas (Barkworth et al,  2007).  It has been 
recommended in the northern Great Plains for passive 
terrace formation (Aase and Pikul, 1995).   
 
Saline and sodic soils: Tall wheatgrass is planted as 
forage on saline and sodic soils where few other 
species will survive (Roundy, 1985; Retana et al., 
1993).  It is one of the most saline tolerant grasses 
commercially available.  In the San Joaquin Valley of 
California, it is used to manage salinity in irrigation 
water recovery systems (Blunk  et al., 2005; Zheng et 
al., 2005).  
 
Biofuel:  Tall wheatgrass is currently being evaluated 
as a possible source of cellulosic ethanol.  Problems 
may exist, however, with biomass production of tall 
wheatgrass in saline environments due to high 
concentrations of salts and heavy metals, as well as 
potentially high emission levels of nitrous and 
sulfuric oxides (Blunk et al., 2005). 
 
Nutrient removal:   In Texas, applications of 
composted dairy manure increased dry matter yields 
and phosphorus and potassium concentrations in tall 
wheatgrass, indicating it could be used for nutrient 
removal (Butler and Muir, 2006). 
 
Particleboard:  The American Soci ety of Agricultural 
Engineers (ASAE) has determined high quality 
particleboard can be produced by using tall 
wheatgrass (Zheng et al., 2005). 
 
Windbreaks:  In a study in Saskatchewan, tall 
wheatgrass windbreaks with several years' growth 
improved soil moisture levels and alfalfa yields 
(Steppuhn and Waddington, 1996). 
 
Wildlife :  Tall wheatgrass provides nesting cover and 
food for upland birds (Asay and Jensen, 1996). 
 
Plant breeding:  Tall wheatgrass is used in breeding 
programs to transfer genes for salinity, drought and 
disease resistance to annual wheat  (Dewey, 1984; 
Sharma & Gill, 1983; Colmer et al., 2006).

Description 
General: Grass family (Poaceae). Tall wheatgrass is a 
tall, long lived perennial bunchgrass reaching 1 to 3 
m (3 to 10 ft) tall. Leaves are green or glaucous 
bluish with blades flat to curling, 2 to 8 mm (0.08 to 
0.31 in) wide. The blades are often covered with 
short, stiff hairs making them scratchy to the touch. 
Auricles are well developed and ligules reach ca 0.7 
mm (0.02 in) long. The infl orescence is a spike with 
a continuous rachis. Internodes in the spike are about 
7 to 20 mm (0.3 to 0.8 in) long. Spikelets are solitary 
at each node each with five to 18 flowers. Glumes are 
thick and hardened, 6 to 11 mm (0.2 to 0.4 in) long 
with 5 to 7 nerves. The tips  of the glumes are truncate 
(abruptly rounded). Lemm as are also thick and 
hardened, 9 to 13 mm (0.4 to 0.5 in) long with a 
truncate to acute apex. Anther s are 4 to 7 mm (0.15 to 
0.20 in) long. 2n=14, 28, 42, 56 or 70 (Welsh et al 
2003). 
 
Distribution : Tall wheatgrass is originally from 
Turkey, Asia Minor and Russia.  It was introduced to 
the U.S. from Turkey in 1909 (Weintraub, 1953) and 
is now found throughout all  western states of the U.S. 
and most Canadian provinces (USDA, 2008; 
Barkworth, et al., 2007). 
 
Adaption 
Tall wheatgrass is adapted to a wide range of soil 
types and climates.  It is often recommended for 12 - 
14 inch and higher precipitation zones or sites with 
high water tables at 4,300 to 6,000 feet elevation 
zones.  It is well adapted to wet, alkaline soils such as 
greasewood and saltgrass sites where the water table 
is from a few inches to several feet below ground 
surface.  It is less drought tolerant than crested 
wheatgrass, however it is adapted to sagebrush, 
mountain brush and juniper sites.  Basin wildrye is a 
good indicator of where tall wheatgrass will be 
successful. 
 
Tall wheatgrass is one of the most saline or alkali 
tolerant cultivated grasses. It can tolerate up to 1% 
soluble soil salts (Vallentine 1961).  Tall wheatgrass 
increases production yields with salinity levels of 
6000 to 18000 ppm and persists in soils with 
conductivity up to electrical  conductivity (EC) of 26 
mmhos/cm (Ogle et al., 2008).  
  Because of its late maturing characteristic, tall 
wheatgrass provides a long
 grazing period (USDA, 
2005).  It has been evaluated in several western states 
for its potential to extend the grazing season.  Studies 
indicate it performs well in New Mexico and Kansas 
(Holechek et al., 1989; Harmoney, 2007), but not in 
Montana (Haferkamp et al., 2005), and results are 
variable in Oklahoma and Texas (Griggs and 
Matches, 1991; Malinkowski et al, 2003; Gillen and 
Berg, 2005; Hopkins, 2005).

Establishment 
Tall wheatgrass should be planted with a drill into a 
firm, weed-free seed bed.  The drill should be set to a 
depth of ½ of an inch on medium to fine textured 
soils and no more than 1 inch deep on coarse textured 
soils.  Recommended seeding rates are 10 pounds 
Pure Live Seed (PLS) per acre on non-saline soils 
and 15 pounds PLS per acre on saline soils.  It is 
usually seeded in pure stan ds or in mixtures with 
grasses also having moderate palatability.  If seeded 
in a mix, adjust seeding rate accordingly.  Under 
dryland conditions, heavy to medium textured soils 
should be seeded in the very early spring, and 
medium to light textured soils should be seeded in the 
late fall.  Irrigated land should be seeded in spring or 
late summer.  Late summer (August – September) 
seedings are not recommended unless irrigation is 
available.

Tall wheatgrass has excellent seedling vigor but is 
slow to establish.  Applications of 2,4-D may be 
necessary to control weeds.  The herbicide should not 
be applied until plants have reached four to six leaf 
stage.  Weeds should be mowed at or prior to bloom 
stage.   
 
To ensure plants become well established, haying and 
grazing should be deferred for at least two growing 
seasons on dryland one growing season on irrigated 
land.   
 
Management 
Tall wheatgrass responds well to irrigation and 
fertilization.  Apply nitrogen in fall or early spring at 
a rate based on soil test results and fertilizer guide 
recommendations.   
 
To maintain stands, 6 inches of stubble should be left 
at the end of the growing season.  Grazing the 
following season should be delayed until there is at 
least 8 inches of new growth.  Tall wheatgrass is 
most palatable during the early spring months and 
should be managed during this time.  If the grass is 
not managed, old coarse growth may inhibit grazing 
the following year.  Tall wheatgrass must be grazed 
heavily to maintain plants in the vegetative state.  
However it does not tolerate continuous close grazing 
and a rest period is required between grazing events 
(USDA, 2005).  In a study to determine influence of 
clipping frequency on yield, Undersander and Naylor 
(1987) found the highest yields of tall wheatgrass 
were produced when clipped at 4 week intervals.  
Supplemental protein must be provided if used for 
winter forage (USDA, 2005). 
 
Environmental concerns:   Tall wheatgrass is long-
lived and spreads slowly.  It is not considered a 
"weedy" or invasive species, but can spread into 
adjoining vegetative communities under favorable 
climatic and environmental conditions.  Research 
indicates that most seedings do not spread from 
original plantings.  It is known to coexist with native 
taxa.  On sites where it is best adapted, it can 
maintain dominance and exist as monoculture.  There 
is no documentation that it crosses with native 
species.   
 
Seed Production 
Tall wheatgrass grown for seed production should be 
planted in 28 to 36- inch rows and cultivated, or 12 to 
14- inch rows uncultivated.  It typically produces 300 
pounds of seed per acre under dryland conditions and 
600 pounds of seed per acre under irrigated 
conditions (NRCS figures). 
  Cultivars, Improved and Selected Materials (and 
area of origin) 
Six cultivars of tall wheatgrass have been released in 
the U.S. and Canada.  Four of the six cultivars: Alkar, 
Nebraska 98526, Orbit and Platte, were all derived 
from PI 98526, which was presented to the USDA by 
N.I. Vavilov in 1932 (Alderson and Sharp, 1994).  A 
new release is planned for 2008 from Nebraska that 
has improved forage quality (Vogel, 2008).  It was 
also developed from PI 98526. 
 
'Alkar'
 tall wheatgrass was developed by the NRCS 
Pullman PMC with seed originating from PI 98526.  
It was released in 1951,  under accession P-2326 for 
certified seed production in  Idaho, Washington and 
Oregon.  In 1958 it was named 'Alkar' and was 
accepted for certification in those states and 
California.  Its intended use was for pasture in wet, 
alkaline conditions and semi-arid regions of the west 
within 270 – 5500 feet elevation.  Certified seed is 
commercially available and the Pullman PMC 
maintains breeder seed.  
 
'Jose'  tall wheatgrass was selected at the former 
NRCS nursery in Albuquerque, MM from seed 
received by Beltsville, MD as BN-3654 and PI 
150123.  It is native to Eurasia but was introduced 
from Australia.  It was selected for its drought and 
saline tolerance.  The nursery released 'Jose' in 1965 
cooperatively with the New Mexico AES and Plant 
Materials Center in Los Lunas, NM.  It is used in 
areas where only very saline water is available for 
use.  It is not as coarse as other tall wheatgrasses.  
Certified seed is commercially available and breeder 
seed is maintained by the Los Lunas PMC. 
 
'Largo' tall wheatgrass was developed by the former 
NRCS nursery in Albuquerque, NM as A-1876, and 
at Utah AES, Logan, ARS cooperating, as PI 109452.  
Seed was originally collect ed by the Westover-Enlow 
expedition near Bandirma, Turkey.  It was introduced 
as  Agropyron intermedium  (Host) Beauv., now 
Thinopyrum intermedium  (Host) Barkworth & D.R. 
Dewey, and later identified as  A. elongatum (Host) 
Beauv.  It was selected  for forage production on 
saline and sodic soils.  The Los Lunas PMC 
maintains breeder seed.  Certified seed is not 
commercially available.  'Largo' has been replaced by 
'Jose'.  
 
'Nebraska 98526'  tall wheatgrass was increased at 
NRCS nurseries in cooperation with Nebraska AES 
in Lincoln.  The seed was first grown at Colorado 
AES in Fort Collins, and in 1936 distributed by the 
NRCS as PI 98526 to nurseries in the Dakotas and 
Nebraska.  In 1950 it was grown on Nebraska farms

for seed production under field certification by 
Nebraska Crop Improvement Association on 
recommendation of Nebraska AES, NRCS and ARS.  
Its intended use was for sodic and saline soils in the 
central and northern Great Plains and intermountain 
west.  It has been replaced by the variety 'Platte', and 
is no longer commercially available.  Nebraska AES 
maintains breeder seed. 
 
'Orbit'  tall wheatgrass was developed by the Canada 
Department of Agriculture Research Station in Swift 
Current, Saskatchewan.  It was developed from 
crosses made between 'Nebraska 98526' and locally 
selected strains.  It was released in 1966 by the 
Canada Department of Agriculture.  It was selected 
for its superior winter hardiness and was intended for 
hay, pasture and conservation plantings in the 
northern Great Plains.  It withstands flooding for 
three to four weeks in the spring.  Certified seed is 
commercially available.  The Canada Department of 
Agriculture Research St ation in Swift Current 
maintains breeder seed.     
 
'Platte'  tall wheatgrass was developed by the 
Nebraska AES in Lincoln, ARS, with L.C. Newell 
cooperating.  It was developed as a cross between 
'Nebraska 96526' and a selection of introductions 
with unknown origin from the Cheyenne, WY, 
Horticultural Field Station.  It was released in 1972 
cooperatively by the Nebraska AES and USDA-ARS, 
University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  Its intended use 
was for vegetating saline-alkali soils in the Great 
Plains.  Certified seed is commercially available.  
The Nebraska AES and USDA-ARS, University of 
Nebraska-Lincoln maintains breeder seed.
