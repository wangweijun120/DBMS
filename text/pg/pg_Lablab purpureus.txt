Uses  
Commercial  crop:  Lablab purpureus  is grown as a pulse 
crop (crop harves ted for dry seed) in Africa,  Asia, and the 
Ca ribbean . It is als o consumed as a green vegetable 
(green bean, pod, leaf) . Maass et al. (2010) observe that L. 
purpureus  may suffer from low yields when grown as  a  
main cash crop, and suggest that it is more popular in 
homegardens  and mixed -cropping schemes. Protein 
isolate from the bean can be used as a food additive for 
improving cake quality (Maass et al., 2010).  
 
Forage:  L. purpureus  is used as forage , hay, and silage. 
As forage, it is oft en sown with sorghum or millet. The 
lea f is very palatable but the stem is not. The seeds are 
moderately palatable. Overall, it is one of the most  palatable legumes for animals (
Valenzuela and Smith, 
2002 ).  
 
The leaf has crude protein of 21  to  38%  and the seed 
contains 20  to 28%  crude protein  (Cook et al., 2005) . The 
seeds contain large amounts of various vitamins and 
minerals, but contain tannins and trypsin inhibitors so 
must be soaked or cooked before human  consumption.   
 
The leaves make excellent hay for cattle and goats, but 
the stem is di fficult to dry, and must be mechanically 
conditioned through crushing (FAO,  2012). Silage made 
from a mix of L. purpureus  and  Sorghum  sp. raised the 
protein content of sorghum by roughly 11 % with a 2:1 
mixture of lablab: sorghum  (FAO,  2012) . 
 
Cover  crop/green manure : L. purpureus  is used as a 
nitrogen- fixing green manure to improve soil quality. It 
often produces more dry matte r than cowpea (Vigna 
unguiculata) , especially during drought, and can produce 
roughly 1,750 lb of leaf matter (Cook et al., 2 005) or 2.5 
tons of total biomass per acre ( Valenzuela and Smith, 
2002 ). Each ton of biomass produced 50 lb of nitrogen 
( Valenzuela and Smith, 2002 ). It not only produces 
nitrogen through fixation, but returns nitrogen through 
leaf decay (FAO,  2012).  Initially growth is slow, but once 
established, it competes well with weeds.  It has an 
extensive root system that improves the physical 
condition and function of the soil.  
 
Wildlife:  L. purpureus  is a good choice for food plots and 
will attract deer. Plots may require electric fencing to 
keep out deer during early seedling development.  
 
Ornamental: Currently the  most common use of  L. 
purpureus
 in the United States is as an ornamental  crop in 
the cut flower industry  (Stevens, 2012) . It is valued for its 
late summer flowers and colorful,  purple peapods. 
Depending on the weather in late summer, harvest yields 
can be up to 55 cut stems per  plant (Anderson et al., 
1996).  
Ethnobotany  
L. purpureus  has been used in the Philippines and China 
as  a stimulant, to reduce fever, to reduce flatulence, to 
stimulate digestion, and as an antispasmodic (Stuart, 
2011). In Namibia, the root has been used to treat heart 
conditions (Pennacchio et al., 2010).  
Status  
L. purpureus  is an introduced species in the United States.   
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current

status ( e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
Description  
General : L.  purpureus  is an herbaceous, climbing,  warm-
season  a nnual or short -lived perennial  with a vigorous 
taproot . It has a thick,  herbaceous stem that can grow up 
to 3 feet, and the climbing vines stretching up to 25 ft 
from the plant (Valenzuela and Smith,  2002) . 
It has trifoliate, long -stemmed  leaves. Each  egg-shaped 
leaflet widens in the middle and is 3 –6 in. (7.5 –15 cm) 
long. The surface of the leaflet is smooth above and short -
haired below.  
 
The flowers grow in clust ers on an unbranched 
inflorescence  in the angle betw een the leaf and the main 
stem.  It may have white, blue, or purple flowers 
depending o n its variety. Seedpods are 2 in. (4 –5 cm) 
(Cook et al., 2005) to 4 in. (10 cm) long  (Venezuela and 
Smith, 2002) , smooth, flat, pointed, and contain 2  to 4 
seed s. Seeds can be  white, cream, pale brown , dark 
brown, red, black , or mottled depending on variety.  
 
Distribution : L. purpureus  is an old world food crop that 
is thought to have originated in Africa (Cook et al., 2005) 
or India (Murphy and Colucci , 1999). It has been 
successfully grown in the Southern United States, Texas, 
Florida, Georgia, Puerto Rico, and as far north as the 
Great Lakes and Canada. It grows from sea level up to 
6,500 ft. (FAO, 2012).  For current distribution, please 
consult the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site.  
 
Habitat : It grows best in the tropics and subtropics . 
 
Adaptation  
L. purpureus  can grow in a variety of soils, from sand to 
clay, in a pH range of 4.5 –7.5 (Cook et al., 2005). It does 
not grow we ll in saline or poorly -drained soils , but it 
grows better than most legumes under acidic conditions 
( Valenzuela and Smith, 2002 ). It  can continue to grow in 
drought or shady conditions, and will grow in areas with 
an average annual rainfall is 25 –120 in. ( Cook et al., 
2005).  It is more drought resistant than other similar 
legumes like common beans ( Phaseolus vulgaris) and 
cowpea  Maass et al., 2010) , and can access soil water 6 
feet deep (Cook et al., 2005).  
 
It grows best where average daily temperatures are 
between 64  to  86°F ; but  it can grow at 37°F for short 
periods (Cook et al., 2005)  and can tolerate light frosts . It 
is better adapted to cold than other warm -season forages 
such as  velvet bean ( Mucuna pruriens ) or cowpea.  
Establishment  
The seed should be inoculated with a cowpea -type, 
Bradyrhizobium  strain as it does not easily nodulate with 
native rhizobia (FAO, 2012).  If grown in the same area, 
inoculant  is not needed in subsequent years, since  rhizobia bacteria will be in the soil. The seeds do not n
eed 
to be scarified, but studies have shown that the seedbed 
should be adequately prepped either through chemical 
preparation or cultivation (Murtagh,  1972).  Natural 
pastures must be cultivated for successful establishment 
(FAO,  2012).  
 
The seed should be sown  1 to  4 in. deep at 11 –18 lb/acre  
on rows 2.5  ft wide with  roughly 1  to  1.5 ft  between 
plants  (Cook et al., 2005) . When planting with grasses, 
reduce the seeding rate by half.  Planting dates should 
coincide with other warm -season legumes. No additional  
fertilizer is necessary (FAO, 2012).  
Management  
L. purpureus  can be used in rotations with cereal s to add 
nitrogen to the soil. It is often used as an intercrop species 
with maize , but should be sown roughly 30 days later than 
maize so as to limit competi tion. It can also be sown as a 
monoculture.   
 
In green manure applications, the crop should be 
terminated before flowering to return maximum amounts 
of N to the soil. The plant can be mowed almost to ground 
level and will regrow , but regrowth will be slowe d by the 
cutting  (Valenzuela and Smith, 2002 ). Fire will kill the 
plant.  
 
L. purpureus  should not be heavily grazed. Grazing can 
beg in 10 weeks from  the date of planting and animals can 
be  grazed 2  to 3 times per season if the plant is not eaten 
below 10 i n. (25 cm) (FAO, 2012). Cutting the plant 
lower will result in delayed regrowth. To avoid bloat, 
supplement the animal’s diet with grasses.  
Pests and Potential Problems  
Generally ,  L. purpureus  is less susceptible to root diseases 
than cowpea (Cook et al., 2005), but can be affected by 
root -knot nematode infection (Valenzuela and Smith, 
2002).  Pod borers can affect  seedpods.  Cutworms and 
wireworms may damage the plant during establishment, 
and  Heliothis  sp., mirids, and thrips  may damage the crop 
during flowering and pod development (Mullen et al., 
2003).  It may develop diseases such as bacterial wilt 
( Xanthomonas  sp .)  and powdery mildew (Cook et al., 
2005).   
Environmental Concerns  
L. purpureus  is a weak perennial and is  not likely to 
spread (FA O, 2012). In some cases, the climbing variety 
of  L. purpureus  has shown some invasive tendencies in 
old fields (Valenzuela and Smith, 2002) . 
 
Seeds and Plant Production  
L. purpureus  is a short -day annual , flowering in response 
to longer nights in late -summer and fall.  It  is mainly self -
fertilizing, and  will set seed withi n the first year after 
planting. Flowering and seedpod production is  sporadic . 
Cook  et al.  (2005) observe d that p lants will produce

roughly 900– 2,000 lb of seed/acre , but FAO (2012) 
observed cases in  South America  where  significantly less 
seed  (450 –900  lb/acre ) was produced . There are r oughly 
1,500 –1,950 seeds per pound  (FAO, 2012).  It will 
produce seed in the Southern United States , includi ng 
Texas, Georgia, and Florida.  
Cultivars,  Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin)  
L. purpureus  is well known  and valued for its 
physiological diversity, and can exhibit both bush and 
twining growth habits, as well as early -flowering and late -
flower ing characteristics. More than  3,000 accessions of 
germplasm have been collected worldwide (Maass et al., 
2010).  Yet despite its morphologica l diversity, the two 
varieties Rongai and Highworth  (both forage varieties) 
seem to be most popular in the United States . Rongai 
(late -flowering)  grows upright and has white flowers  that 
bloom when there is less than  11 hours of daylight (FAO, 
2012) . Highworth (early -flowering)  is a twining variety 
that has purple blooms. There is also an earlier flowering 
variety from East Texas called Rio Verde  that flowers 
after 55 days.
