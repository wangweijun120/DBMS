Festuca arizonica  Vasey 
Plant Symbol = FEAR2

Alternate Names 
Arizona fescue has also been referred to as mountain 
bunch grass and pine grass (USDA, ARS, NGRP, 
2008). 
 
Uses 
Grazing/Rangeland:
 Arizona fescue is moderately 
palatable to cattle and horses, and to a lesser extent, 
domestic sheep.  In late summer the herbage 
decreases slightly in palatability.  It has moderate 
grazing tolerance. It produces a large amount of 
forage and remains fairly green from spring to fall.  
The over-all forage value has been rated good to 
excellent (Sampson, 1952; Herzman, et al., 1975; 
Guker 2006). 
 
Erosion Control : 
 Arizona fescue has an extensive 
root system making it a valuable plant for soil 
stabilization.  It has moderate drought and shade 
tolerant qualities (USDA, SCS, NM, 1982; Gay and 
Dwyer, 1965; NMSU, CES, 1977; Wasser, 1982). 
 
Reclamation/Restoration:
  Arizona fescue has 
performed well on slightly acid mine waste materials 
in areas receiving adequate precipitation 
(USDA,SCS, PMC, 1988) 
 
Wildlife Habitat
:   Arizona fescue has been reported 
to provide forage for deer, elk, antelope, mountain 
goat and bighorn sheep. In addition, Arizona fescue 
has been reported to provide food and cover for a  number of small mammals and birds (Guker, 2006; 
SCS, PMC, 1988). 
 
Recreational/Residential:
   Arizona fescue does not 
tolerate trampling, and will not  withstand foot traffic.  
Arizona fescue can be used as an ornamental in 
landscape gardens (USDA, SCS, NM, 1982; SCS, 
PMC, 1988; Univ. of Idaho, Ext., 2008) 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status (e.g. threat ened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description 
General :
 Arizona fescue is a native, cool season, long 
lived perennial bunch grass. The plant has no 
rhizomes.  The culms or stems can range from about 
1 to 3 feet tall, clustered, pale blue-green, and are 
rough to the touch.  Leaf  blades are mostly basal, 
pale blue-green, 6 to 10 inches long, shaped like a 
string, and rough to the touch.  The inflorescence is a 
panicle about 3-8 inches long.  It has a deep, dense 
fibrous root system (Harrington, 1954; Guker, 200; 
Gay, et al., 1965) 
 
Distribution : 
 
For individual county distribution, within each state 
where Arizona fescue occurs, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site. 
 
Habitat:
  Arizona fescue occurs in almost pure stands 
under coniferous canopies.   Grass species such as 
blue grama ( Bouteloua gracilis ) and mountain muhly 
( Muhlenbergia montana ) are sometimes found 
growing along with Arizona fescue (Guker, 2006).  
 
Adaptation 
Arizona fescue is commonly found on dry, shallow, 
clay loam soils; however, it can also grow on loams 
and sandy to gravelly soils.  It most often grows in 
association with ponderosa pi ne at elevations of 6000 
to 10000 feet and on sites receiving at least 10 inches 
of annual precipitation. It  grows better on areas that 
receive 14 inches of precipitation in a year.  It occurs 
from Colorado south to Texas and west to Nevada.  
Arizona fescue is moderately shade and drought 
tolerant. It has been reported to survive most fires 
and recovers quickly with monsoon rains in 
ponderosa pine forests of Arizona and New Mexico 
(Thornburg, 1982; Wasser, 1982; NMSU, CES, 
1977; Gay et al., 1965; Sampson, 1952).

Establishment 
It is recommended to fall plant Arizona fescue, unless 
irrigation water is available for establishment during 
early spring or at other times during the year.  The 
seed can be drilled or broadcast.  Drill seed ¼ to ½ 
inch deep in a clean, weed-free seedbed.  Two to 9 
pounds of Pure Live Seed per acre have been 
recommended for establishment under irrigation, and 
half this recommended rates for dry land plantings.  
For critical area planting 4-9 pounds of Pure Live 
Seeds have been recommended (Hijar, 2002; 
Sharkoff, 2002; USDA, SCS, AZ, 1983; USDA, 
SCS, NM, 1982; NMSU, CES, 1977). 
 
Management  
Control weeds and withhold grazing during the 
seedling year.  Arizona fescue will tolerate moderate 
grazing, but stands will decline under close grazing 
or heavy use. Use proper grazing management to 
keep a healthy stand (Was ser, 1982; USDA, SCS, 
AZ, 1983). 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
No pests for Arizona fescue were found in the 
literature reviewed.  Allelopathic effects of Arizona 
fescue were observed in the laboratory in seedlings of 
bottlebrush squirreltail, blue grama and ponderosa 
pine (Guker, 2006). 
 
Environmental Concerns 
None were reported in the references reviewed. 
 
Seeds and Plant Production 
 
 Arizona fescue seeds (Source: Steve Hurst @ USDA-
NRCS PLANTS Database)  
 
Seed production fields have been planted at 36 inches 
or more between rows to aid with cultivation for 
weed control and for roguing off-type plants.  Yields 
up to 200 pound per acre of clean seed have been 
reported using the releas e ‘Redondo’ (USDA-SCS, 
AZ, 1983).   
Arizona fescue has 480,500 seeds per pound (USDA, 
NRCS, 2008) 
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and 
area of origin) 
‘Redondo’ Arizona fescue is the only cultivar release 
of this species.  ‘Redondo” was released in 1973 by 
New Mexico State University; Colorado State 
University; New Mexico State Highway Department, 
and the Natural Resources Conservation Service 
(formerly Soil Conservation Service) of the United 
States Department of Agriculture. 
 
The release ‘Redondo’ or
iginated from a 1956 
collection west of Los Alamos, New Mexico.  Initial 
testing and selection was conducted at Los Lunas 
Plant Materials center, New Mexico; Bridger Plant 
Materials center, Montana;  and field locations in 
Colorado and New Mexico (Alderson and Sharp, 
1994; SCS, PMC, 1988; NMSU, CES, 1977). 
 
‘Redondo” Arizona fescue is available commercially 
and foundation seed is maintained at Upper Colorado 
Environmental Plant Cent er, Meeker, Colorado.
