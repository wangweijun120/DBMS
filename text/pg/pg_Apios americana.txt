Uses 
Ethnobotanic : 
According to Kelly 
Kindscher (1987), 
“groundnut is a 
common native food plant  of temperate, eastern 
North America.  Its distri bution reaches west to the 
wet margins of prairies, where it was once used 
extensively by the Native Americans.” 
 
Groundnut was a source of food among the Omaha, 
Dakota, Santee Sioux, Cheyenne, Osage, Pawnee, 
and Hidatsa (Gilmore 1913, Grinnell 1962, Matthews 
1961, Wilson 1987).  Groundnut was excavated from 
four Ozark bluff-dweller sites in Arkansas.  The 
Ozark peoples are regarded as pre-Columbian 
(Beardsley 1939).  Groundnuts “roots” were dug in 
the winter.  The tubers were gathered all year but 
were best when harvested from late Fall through 
early spring.  They were eaten raw, cooked, or dried 
and ground for flour.  Some of the “roots” were 
boiled, peeled, and dried fo r storage.  The seeds are 
cooked and eaten lik e peas in summer. 
 
Groundnut was also an important food of New 
England colonists (Hedrick 1919).  Once the 
colonists discovered the groundnut, they enacted a 
town law to prevent Indians from digging groundnut 
on English land.  Groundnut tubers are a good source  of carbohydrates and contain between 13 and 17 
percent protein by dry weight, or about three times 
more than potatoes or any other widely used 
vegetable root (Yanovsky and Kingsbury 1938, Watt 
and Merrill 1963).

Description 
General : Legume Family (Fabaceae).  Groundnut 
( Apios americana ) is a perennial herb from slender 
rhizomes with tuberous thickenings 1.3-4 cm (0.5-1.6 
in) thick, and stems twining or climbing over other 
plants.  The leaves are alternate, pinnately, egg-
shaped, 2-10 cm (3/4-4 in)  long, 1.8-7 cm (0.7-2.7 in) 
wide, and sometimes hairy.   The flowers are in 
rounded clusters among leaves.  Groundnut blooms 
from July to October.  The flowers have 5 parts, the 
upper one round, white and reddish brown, the 2 side 
wings curved down and brown-purple, the lower 2 
petals sickle-shaped and brownish red.  The fruits are 
dry, straight or slightly curved, narrow, and 5-10 mm 
(3/16-3/8 in) long.  The fleshy legume fruits are 6-12 
mm (0.2-.5 in) in diameter and indehiscent (the fruit 
coils back after opening), usually with 1 seed.  The 
seeds are oblong or square, dark brown, with 
wrinkled surfaces. 
 
Distribution 
For current distribution,  please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site.  Groundnut is distributed through the great 
prairie from Quebec to  Minnesota, North Dakota, 
south to north central Colorado, Florida, and Texas. 
 
Establishment 
Adaptation : Groundnut grows in wet meadows, low 
thickets, banks of streams and ponds, sloughs, moist 
prairie ravines, and moist soil in woodlands.   
 
Propagation from Cuttings: Plant tubers two to three 
inches deep in the early spring (Kindscher 1992).  
After shoots establishment, mulch to stop 
competition from weeds and grass.  Provide the 
young shoots with a traverse or other objectives upon 
which to climb.  After one year of growth, several

one inch-thick tubers can be harvested from each 
plant.  Because of their vining nature, groundnut 
would be hard to grow on a field scale, and their 
annual yield appears to be quite low in comparison to 
other crops.  Groundnut is difficult to cultivate 
mechanically, because each tuber can sprout and 
grow in the spring, fillin g in spaces between rows. 
Management
