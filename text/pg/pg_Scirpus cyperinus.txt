WOOLGRASS 
Scirpus cyperinus  (L.) Kunth 
Plant Symbol = SCCY  
 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS National Plant Data 
Center 
 
Alternative Names 
cotton grass bulrush, common wool-grass 
 
Uses 
Ethnobotanic: Woolgrass stems were woven to make 
matting and ropes.  The fruiting tops of the plant 
were used as a resilient material for stuffing and 
making pillows (Moerman 1998).  The small rushes 
were used in making woven mats and storage bags 
(Ibid.). 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status, such as, state noxious status and 
wetland indicator values. 
 
Description 
General : Sedge family (Cyperaceae).  Woolgrass 
( Scirpus cyperinus ) is a tall perennial with slender 
culms.  This species is an  erect grasslike plant that 
commonly grows four to five feet (Tiner 1987).  The 
leaves are smooth, flat, elongated, and up to ½ inch 
wide.  The flowers occur in dense rounded clusters of 
greenish-brown spiklets arising from the top of the 
culm.  The fruits are yello w-gray to white achenes 
surpassed by long red-brown bristles at maturity. 
 
Distribution : Scirpus cyperinus  ranges from New 
England and New York westward across Ohio to  Iowa, and southward to North Carolina and 
Oklahoma.  It is also found from Newfoundland to 
Minnesota south to Florida and Louisiana (Tiner 
1987).  For current distribution, please consult the 
Plant profile page for this species on the PLANTS 
Web site. 
 
Adaptation 
Woolgrass is found in irregularly flooded tidal fresh 
marshes, inland marshes, wet meadows, and swamps.  
This species grows best in areas with wet soil 
moisture content and is seldom found in more than a 
few inches of water (Voss 1972).  It prefers peat or 
sandy soil types in full to partially sunny locations.

Establishment 
Propagation by Seed
: Scirpus cyperinus  seeds should 
be sown in a cold frame as soon as they are ripe in a 
pot standing in three centimeters of water.  The seeds 
germinate quickly.  When they are large enough to 
handle, plant them into their permanent positions in 
early summer. 
 
Large divisions can be planted directly into their 
permanent positions.  It is best to pot smaller 
divisions and grow them in a cold frame, out-planting 
when they are well established in the summer. 
 
Management 
After seed planting, water level over  Scirpus 
cyperinus  seeds should be mainta ined at one foot for 
two weeks.  Periodic flooding up to three feet should 
occur until the seeds are established.
