FORAGE KOCHIA 
Bassia prostrata (L.) A.J. Scott  
Plant Symbol = BAPR5 
Alternate Names   
Common Names:  prostrate summer cypress, perennial 
summer cypress  
Scientific Names:  Kochia prostrata  
Description  
General : Goosefoot Family (Chenopodiaceae).  Forage 
kochia is an introduced, semi -evergreen, half -shrub. 
Plants are 0.3 to 1 m (1 to 3 ft ) tall with a deep tap root 
and an extensive fibrous root system, and it may live up to 
10 to15 years. Although it is commonly only medium -
lived, it readily re -establishes from seed. Leaves are 
linear, 3 to 12 mm long (0.1 to 0.5 inches) and hairy. 
Flowers  are clustered on a spicate to paniculate 
inflorescence in the upper stems. Seed stalks and upper 
stems turn red in late summer and fall, while the lower 
branches retain a green appearance year round. (Harrison 
et al., 2000). Flowers bloom from July to September 
(McArthur and Monsen, 2004).   
  Two subspecies have been used in the United States. 
Subspecies 
virescens ([Fenzl] Prat.) is a diploid (2n=18) 
subspecies represented by the release ‘Immigrant’. 
Subspecies  grisea (Prat.) is represented by the tetraploi d 
(2n=36) release ‘Snowstorm’. Subspecies grisea  is taller 
in stature, typically reaching approximately 76 cm (30 in) 
compared to the low -growing  virescens  which normally 
reaches heights of 30 to 38 cm (12 to 15 in). Subspecies 
grisea  also exhibits more pu bescence than subspecies 
virescens . 
 
Forage kochia should not be confused with its weedy 
relative,  Kochia scoparia. Forage kochia differs in that it 
is a perennial shrub and not an annual herb.  
Distribution :  This species has been successfully seeded 
in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New 
Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming 
at elevations ranging from 490 to 2,200 m  (1,600 to 7,300 
ft).  For current distribution, consult the Plant Profile page 
for this species on the PLANTS Web site.  
Habitat :  Forage kochia is well adapted to a broad range 
of growing conditions found in the Intermountain West. 
Plants are commonly found in shadscale -saltbush, (saline 
desert and desert shrub), sagebrush st eppe and piñon-
juniper communities  where it has been planted as a 
greenstrip species or for rangeland rehabilitation.  
Adaptation  
Forage kochia is well suited to rangelands receiving 15 to 
40 cm annual precipitation (6 to 16 in ), and is adapted to a 
wide range of soil textures including sands, gravels, clays, 
silts and loams. Plants do best in medium -textured soils. 
Forage kochia is highly saline and sodic tolerant. Plants 
perform well and will spread in high saline s ites including 
slick spots (Harrison et al.,  2000). Stevens et al (1984) 
reported that forage yields were not reduced when forage 
kochia plants were grown in soil salinity of 17.0 
mmho/cm
2.   
 
Uses  
Range/livestock:  
Forage kochia is highly nutritious to cattle and is most 
commonly used for standing fall and winter forage as an 
alternative to harvested hay. Crude protein levels range 
from 7 to 14% during fall and winter months (August to 
March) with higher protein leve ls than perennial cool 
season grasses, forbs and legumes during that period. 
Forage kochia plants do not develop nitrate accumulation 
or oxalate toxicity (Koch and Asay, 2001). For the best 
nutritional benefits, a combination of forage kochia and 
dormant g rass during fall and winter months is 
recommended (ZoBell et al 2004).

Range Rehabilitation : 
Forage kochia was originally introduced into the U.S. to 
compete with halogeton ( Halogeton glomeratus). It has 
since been shown to compete well against other 
aggressive, exotic annual weeds such as cheatgrass 
( Bromus tectorum ), Russian thistle ( Salsola kali) and 
medusahead ( Taeniatherum caput -medusae ). (Koch and 
Asay, 2001; Young and Clements, 2004). Studies have 
shown that forage kochia begins growth at very cool  
temperatures and thus photosynthesizes at the same time 
of year as cheatgrass providing direct competition for 
limited water resources (Monaco, 2004). Plantings of 
forage kochia can decrease densities of annual weeds, 
thus decreasing fire intervals of degraded rangelands 
while providing valuable  forage to livestock and forage 
and cover for wildlife and upland game birds.

Greenstrip Plantings : 
Forage kochia has been successfully used for greenstrip or 
firebreak plantings in the Intermountain West for several 
reasons. Forage kochia is well adapted to the very dry 
areas of the region and establishes easily. Plants are 
competitive against annual we eds, thus decreasing the 
fine fuel load and fire interval. Forage kochia forms open 
stands, with individual plants having an open canopy. 
Forage kochia is fire tolerant and remains green through 
the fire season (Pellant, 1994). The evaluated fuel 
moisture  content of species commonly used in greenstrip 
plantings following a wildfire including forage kochia 
was estimated at 40 percent as compared to crested 
wheatgrass (10 percent) and cheatgrass (1 percent). 
Forage kochia plants will burn with sufficient fuel  but the 
plants quickly recover (Monsen and Kitchen, 1999). 
Studies show that forage kochia reduces flame intensity 
and can suppress or even stop wildfires (Harrison et al., 
2002).

Status  
T his  plant may become weedy or invasive in some 
regions or habitats and may displace desirable vegetation 
if not properly managed.  Please consult w ith your local 
NRCS Field Office, Cooperative Extension Service 
office, state natural resource, or state agriculture 
department regarding its status and use . 
Planting Guidelines  
Best establishment comes from dormant fall or winter 
seedings which allow the seed to germinate and begin 
growth very early in the spring. Seed should be broadcast, 
aerially seeded, or drilled onto the soil surface which has 
been lightly disturbed by harrowing or spread directly 
onto snow. Seed drilled and pressed into soil to depth s 
more than 1/16 inches (1.5 mm) will rarely germinate or 
establish. Burning prior to seeding has positively affected 
establishment (Monaco et al., 2003). Aerial seeding 
should be performed at altitudes from 50 to 70 meters 
(165 to 230 ft) with wind veloci ties less than 13 feet per 
second (Harrison et al., 2000).  
 
For wildlife plantings, forage kochia should be used as 
part of a seed mixture. Seeding rates range from 0.025 to 
0.25 lb PLS per acre depending on conditions and 
objectives. Planting 0.025 lb PL S per acre as a seed 
mixture component provides approximately 400 plants 
per acre (Ogle et al., 2006).   
 
For greenstrip plantings, where forage kochia is planted 
as a monoculture with a drill and seed is pressed into soil, 
higher seeding rates (2.0 –  3.0 lb/acre or 18 to 27 
seeds/ft
2) are recommended to create a thick stand of 
kochia with smaller, lower -growing plants, which provide 
little fuel for wildfires and reduces annual weed 
production. Under greenstrip  conditions, when seed is 
broadcast planted, seeding rates should be increased to 
3.0 - 4.0 lb/acre or 27 to 36 seeds/ft
2. 
Forage kochia seed loses viability quickly, even when 
processed and stored under proper conditions. Always use 
current year’s seed that has received a recent germination 
test to ensure the best chances for establishment success.

Management 
Forage kochia can be used as year round forage under 
proper management. Spring grazing can be more 
detrimental to forage production than fall or winter 
grazing; however, it is rarely grazed during the spring 
when green grass is available. The earliest grazing occurs 
in late June to mid July when the grasses have gone 
dormant. Its “preference” increases throughout the 
summer and early fall. Plants grazed to less than two 
inches will show reduced growth the following year. In 
one study in Box Elder County, Utah, forage yields 
ranged from 500 to  700 lbs per acre (ZoBell et al.,  2004). 
 
Pests and Potential Problems  
Although forage kochia does not appear to be affected by 
insect pests, it may serve as a host for lygus bugs 
(Harrison et al ., 2000).  
 
Environmental Concerns  
There is concern that forage kochia could become 
invasive similar to the herbaceous kochia, K. scoparia , 
but this is mostly unwarranted. Studies indicate that plants 
will spread under favorable conditions into bare or 
disturbed sites where competition is limited. Forage 
kochia competes with and establishes readily into sites 
dominated by annual weeds, but it does not seem to 
reduce the density  of stands of established perennials. 
Spread of forage kochia has been found to be related to 
the following: soil disturbance, predominant wind 
direction, lack of vegetative competition and open space 
near established plants (Harrison, 2000).  
 
One source of concern is the  ability  of forage kochia to 
invade slick  spot communities in southern Idaho. These 
sites are habitat for the  federally-listed  threatened  species, 
slickspot peppergrass ( Lepidium papilliferum) (Pellant, 
2004).  
 
It has been shown that forage  kochia is only distantly 
related to annual kochia and Grey Molly (Kochia 
americana), and will not hybridize with either species 
(Lee et al., 2005).  
Control  
Forage  kochia can be effectively controlled with 2,4 -D 
(Harrison et al 2000). C ontact your local agricultural 
extension specialist or county weed specialist to 
determine the best control methods  in your area and how 
to use it safely.  Always read and follow label and safety 
instructions for each chemical  control method.  Trade 
names  and control measures appear in this document only 
to provide specific information.  USDA NRCS does not 
guarantee or warranty the products and control methods 
named, and other products may be equally effective.  
Seeds and Plant Production  
Seed production fields should be planted at a rate of 1.5 lb 
PLS per acre or planted with transplants with 12 inch in -
row plant spacing and three feet between -row spacing  (Harrison et al 2000; Cornforth et al 2001). Seed 
production fields produce between 400 and 600 pounds 
p
er acre of clean seed (Cornforth et al., 2001).  Stevens et 
al (1984) reported production as high as 1,500 pounds per 
acre during one production year, however seed production 
rates this high should not be expected under normal 
circumstances.  
Seed requires a hard fall frost before it will mature. Seed 
fields in areas with a tendency to early to mid fall 
snowfall have resulted in complete seed production 
failure because the snow caused seed to drop before seed 
harvest could occur. Seed production begins to de cline 
after plants are approximately 5 to 6 years old.  
 
There are an estimated 395,000 PLS per pound. (Koch & 
Asay 2001; Harrison et al 2000). Seed needs to be dried to 
less than 7 percent moisture and stored in cool, dry 
conditions, 36 to 50º F (2.2 to 10º C). 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin)   
‘Immigrant’  forage kochia was released in 1984  by the 
USDA Forest Service, USDA Natural Resources 
Conservation Service, Utah Division of Wildlife 
Resources and the Idaho, Nevada, Orego n and Utah 
Agriculture Experiment Stations. The original collection 
was from the Stravopol Botanical Gardens, USSR, in May 
1966. Immigrant was released for use as forage and soil 
erosion control on rangelands in the Intermountain West 
(Stevens et al 1984).  Immigrant is a diploid (2n=18) 
release of subspecies virescens . Breeder and Foundation 
seed is maintained by Utah Crop Improvement 
Association.  
 
‘Snowstorm’ forage kochia (left) and ‘Immigrant’ forage kochia right.   
Use of Immigrant forage kochia for winter grazing has 
been limited due to the plant’s fairly low stature.

‘Snowstorm’ forage kochia was released in 2012 by the 
USDA Agricultural Research Service in Logan, Utah 
based on improved stature, productivity and nutritional 
content compared to Immigrant. Snowstorm, a tetraploid 
(2n=36) release of subspecies  grisea, was developed as a 
synthetic cultivar using germplasm collected in 
Uzbekistan. It was shown to be 64% taller, produce 68% 
more forage, have 22% higher pr otein content, and be 4% 
more digestible than Immigrant forage kochia. Breeder, 
Foundation, and Certified seed classes will be recognized. 
Breeder and Foundation seed will be maintained by the 
USDA -ARS Forage and Range Research Laboratory at 
Logan, UT. Foundation seed will be made available 
through the Utah Crop Improvement Association.
