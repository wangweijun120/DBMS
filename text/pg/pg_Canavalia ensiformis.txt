Uses  
Commercial crop: Outside of the United States  b oth 
young pods and green seeds are eaten as a vegetable. 
Seeds are also used as a co ffee substitute. The mature 
bean contains potentially harmful saponins, cyanogenic 
glycosides, terpenoids, alkaloids, and tannic acid 
(Udedibie and Carlini, 1998) and must be cooked before 
eating. There is also pharmaceutical interest in the use of 
C. ensi formis  as a source for the anti -cancer agents 
trigonelline and canavanine (Morris, 1999). Jack bean 
seed  has been promoted in developing nations as a 
potential source of affordable and abundant protein. It has 
29.0% protein content (Adebowale and Lawal, 2004).  
 
Livestock feed:  In the United States, jack bean is grown 
mainly as animal feed. Grazing animals do not prefer jack 
bean  to other green manures (Bunch et al., 1985) and 
although nutritious, it is coarse and unpalatable (Allen 
and Allen, 1981). Forag e yields have reached roughly 8 –10 tons/ac (FAO, 2012) and 15 tons/ac in Hawaii (Allen 
and Allen, 1981). 
 
 
The plant has also been used as silage  and the seeds are 
ground for livestock. Adding molasses to jack bean  seed  
meal may help increase its palatabil ity (FAO, 2012). Seed 
meal may be toxic if too much is consumed and should 
either be heat -treated to destroy potentially lethal 
enzymes or limited to 30% of the ration (FAO, 2012). 
Moist heat is more effective at destroying trypsin 
inhibitors in  C. ensiformis than dry heat (Udedibie and 
Carlini, 1998). Caution should be used when using the 
seed as human food or animal feed. The most harmful 
antinutritional protein, concanavalin A, is somewhat 
protected from heat treatment (Udedibie and Carlini, 
1998). Even  minute amounts of this protein  may be 
harmful to animals.  
 
Cover crop/green manure:  As a cover crop jack bean 
produces  phytochemicals that act as a pesticide, 
bactericide, and a fungicide (Morris, 1999). The canopy 
of  jack bean can establish 85% cover 60 days after 
emergence and produces roughly 4,915- 6,250 lb/ac of dry 
matter  (Bayorbor et al., 2006;  Florentin et al., 2004). It 
has been used successfully to fix nitrogen and control 
weeds under fruit trees (Bunch et al., 1985). Jack bean 
can fix between 167 –205 lb  N/ac (Bayorbor et al., 2006 ; 
Benjawan  et al., 2007). It works well  suppressing 
vigorous weeds, such as  Pennisetum  spp., and can provide 
rapid ground cover in agricultural plantations (Kobayashi 
et al., 2003).  Because jack bean has been shown to 
pro duce large amounts of biomass in both sun and shade, 
it has potential for use in silvopastoral systems (Bazill, 
1987).   
 
Soil biofumigant : Incorporating  jack bean dry  matter  into 
the soil has reduced root galling in tomatoes and 
increased tomato plant heig ht and weight (Morris and 
Walker, 2002).  Jack bean  has  been successfully used to 
increase yield and to suppress nematode  (Pratylenchus 
zeae ) populations  and root necrosis  when intercropped 
with maize ( Arim et al., 2006). Farmer Participatory 
Research (FPR) in Uganda showed that jack bean  
intercropped with banana, coffee, sweet potatoes, or 
cassava is a preferred green manure among farmers 
(Fischler and Wortmann, 1999). However, research by 
McIntyre et al. ( 2001) has shown that intercropping 
banana with jack bean had no beneficial effect on 
nematode populations.   
 
Aquaculture:  Detoxified jack bean  seed  has been used 
successfully as a high protein fish meal substitute in 
tilapia aquaculture (Martinez -Palacios  et al., 1987).  
Natural Resources Conservation Service  Plant Guide

Phytoremediation: Jack bean can be grown in soils with 
high lead concentration and  has potential to be used for 
restoration of lead -contaminated soils (Faria Pereira et al., 
2010).  
Wildlife:  It is pollinated by solitary bees and carpenter 
b ees.   
Ethnobotany  
Leaves are spread on leafcutter anthills to eliminate ants 
(Bunch et al., 1985). In Nigeria, jack bean seed is used as 
an antibiotic and antiseptic (Olowokudejo et al., 2008).
 
Historically, it was used by native tribes for food and 
forage  in droughty regions of Arizona and Mexico.   
Status  
Jack bean  is an introduced species in the United States. 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
 
Description  
General : Jack bean is an annual or weak perennial legume 
with climbing or bushy growth forms. It is woody with a 
long tap root. The 8 in (20 cm) long and 4 in (10 cm) 
wide leaves have three egg -shaped leaflets, are wedge-
shaped at the base, and taper towards the tip. The 1 in (2.5 
cm) long flowers are rose -colored, purplish, or white with 
a red base. It has a 12 in (30 cm) long, 1.5 in (3.8 cm) 
wide, sword -shaped seedpod. Seeds are white and smooth 
with a brown seed scar that is about one- third the length 
of the s eed. Its roots have nodules which fix nitrogen.

Distribution : Found in the tropics, subtropics, West 
Africa, Asia, Latin America, Sout h America, India, and 
South Pacific —mainly in cultivation. It is also grown in 
the southwestern United States and Hawaii. Canavalia is a 
pantropical genus that is believed to have originated in the 
New World based on the large genetic diversity of species 
in the fossil record (Saur and Kaplan, 1969).  
  For current distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.
 
 
Habitat : Jack bean will become established in disturbed 
upland areas where average rainfall is 28 –165 i n 
(NAS/NRC, 1979). It is shade -tolerant (Bunch, 2003), 
grows best in a temperature range of 57 –81°F, and is 
found at elevations up to 5,900 ft. (NAS/NRC, 1979).  
 
Adaptation  
A distinguishing characteristic of this plant is its ability to 
continuously grow under severe environmental conditions 
(Udedibie and Carlini, 1998), even in nutrient -depleted, 
highly leached, acidic soils (NAS/NRC, 1979). Jack bean 
is drought -resistant and immune to pests (FAO, 2012; 
Bunch et al, 1985). It can grow in poor droughty soil s, 
and does not grow well in excessively wet soil. It will 
drop its leaves under extremely high temperatures, and 
may tolerate light frosts (Florentin et al., 2004).   
 
Establishment  
Jack bean should be planted in full sun to light shade in 
seed beds roughl y 1.5–3 ft apart, in late spring/early 
summer, at 50 –60 lb/ac. For weed suppression, 
researchers have planted 4 –5 seeds per square meter (80 
lbs/acre)
 (Bunch, 1985). Its initial growth may be slower 
in more northern latitudes, and it flowers after 4 –5 mont hs 
(Bunch et al., 1985). If interseeding jack bean  with corn 
or sorghum, seed should be drilled 15– 30 days after 
sowing the main crop, and after being soaked in water for 
24 hours (Bunch et al., 1985). Sowing the intercrop at 
least 15 days after the main cash crop will limit the 
potential negative effects of plant competition (Caamal -
Maldonado et al., 2001). It does not require staking.  
 
Management  
When used as a cover crop or green manure the plant 
should be terminated mechanically with a roller -crimper 
or  chemically when it first begins to flower. Because jack 
bean is an annual or very short -lived perennial, it may 
have to be reestablished each year if used as a weed 
smothering plant.  
Pests and Potential Problems  
Jack bean has no significant pests or diseases (NAS/NRC, 
1979). The toxicity of the seeds makes them unpalatable 
to insects and protects them from insect attack (Oliveira et 
al., 1999).  
 
Environmental Concerns  
The plant can become naturalized beyond its native range. 
It is not an environmental weed  or parasitic.  
Seeds and Plant Production  
Green pods are produced in 80– 120 days and mature 
seeds produced after 180 –300 days (FAO, 2012). Jack 
bean can produce up to 4,105 lb/ac dry seed (NAS/NRC,

1979), but amounts around 892 lb/ac are more common. 
There are approximately 658 seed/lb (Acosta, 2009).  
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin)   
There has been limited cultivar development of this 
species. Most plant development has been performed by 
agricultural experiment stations an d has focused on 
selecting cultivars with low toxicity (NAS/NRC, 1979). 
Both viny and bushy varieties exist.
