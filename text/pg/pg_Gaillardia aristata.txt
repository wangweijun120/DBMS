Uses  
Blanketflower is a native perennial wildflower useful 
for adding species diversity in native plant seed 
mixes for  rehabilitation of disturbed sites. It  can be 
used  in produc ing native wildflower sod for 
restoration of native  plant colonies  (Airhart, 1988) . 
Blanketflower is suitable for use as an ornamental 
wildflower in low maintenance or naturalistic 
landscapes. It has utility as a cover and food source 
for pollinators, wildlife, and livestock.  
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site (USDA- NRCS,

Resources for this plant’s current status ( e.g., 
threatened or endangered speci es, state noxious 
status, and wetland indicator values).  
Description  
General : Bl anketflower  Gaillardia aristata  is a 
native, herbaceous perennial in the Aster family. 
Gaillardia  was named in honor of Gaillard de 
Marentonneau, an 18
th  century French patron of 
botany (Bailey, 1929). The name aristata  is derived  fr
om,  arist , Latin  for bristle, in reference to the hairy 
stems and leaves, and the awn -like bristles on the 
single -seeded fruit (achene). The blanketflower 
inflorescence is said  to resemble the colorful, 
intricate patterns woven into blankets made by Native 
Americans (Kimball and Lesica, 2005). 
Blanketflower is found in grasslands, woodlands, and 
montane meadows. Its natural range extends from 
southern Canada on both sides of the  Rocky 
Mountains, south to Utah, Colorado, and South 
Dakota (Strickler, 1993).  
Taxonomy:
 Blanketflower is tap rooted, with one or 
commonly several, erect stems from the base 
(Hitchcock et al., 1955). The pubescent plant grows 
to a height of 26 inches  with rough- hairy, lance-
shaped, alternate leaves, 6  inches  long, 1  inch wide, 
entire to coarsely -toothed, or rarely pinnately divided 
( Hermann,  1966). The flower heads are radiate, 
showy, solitary to few, with an outer series of ray 
flowers and an inner group of disk flowers. There are 
typically 13, sterile, 0.6 to 1.4  inches long, ligulate 
(strap -shaped), yellow ray flowers with purple bases 
(eFloras, 20 11). The  number and shape of the ray 
flowers is variable, as is the number of lobes in a ray 
(Robbins,  1908). A normal flower head has a large 
number of ligulate and tubular -shaped rays, with the 
latter shape being four -lobed. A few flower heads 
have all tubular rays.  The purple, perfect (both 
stamens and pistil) disk flowers are 0.3 to 0.35 in ch 
lo ng, with  long hairs at the top (Lesica, 2002). The 
overall appearance of the central disk flowers are said 
to resemble big, brown eyes, hence the alternative 
common name, brown -eyed Susan (Talk About 
Wildlife, 20 11). The receptacle is convex to 
subglobose, with ch affy or sometimes soft, spine -like 
bristles that do not individually subtend the disk 
flowers (Hitchcock and Cronquist, 1973). The fruit is 
a one -seeded, gray -brown achene, 0.12 to 0.16 inch 
long, with densely ascending hairs, a short pappus 
crown 0.3 to 0.4  inch long, and awns approximately 
two times as long as the fruit body (Jepson Manual, 
2011 ). The chromosome number for blanketflower is 
2 n = 34 (Taylor and Brockman, 1966).
 
Distribution:  The native range  of blanketflower 
extends from south -central Canad a to southern 
Colorado, east to the Dakotas and west to the 
Cascade Mountains of Washington and the Blue 
Mountains of Oreg on (Marlowe and Hufford, 2007).  
For current distribution, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
sit e.

Habitat: Blanketflower  prefers dry, open spaces in 
prairies, mountain foothills, and along roadsides and 
railroad rights -of -way (Vance et al., 1999).  It is a 
mid -successional species capable of growing in dense 
populations on disturbed sites (Taylor, 1992). 
Blanketflower  is adapted to a wide range of well -
drained soils and is drought tolerant. It  grows well on 
dry to mesic, well -drained sites in areas receivi ng 10 
to 30 in ches of annual precipitation. Plant growth and 
development is dependent on site location, with a 
wide range of dates in emergence and floral 
initiation . 
Adaptation  
In Montana, presence of blanketflower has been 
documented in all 56 counties ( Booth and Wright, 
1959), including nine types of riparian plant 
communities (Hansen et al., 1995). It is an important 
component of several habitat types in western 
Montana ( Hermann, 1966). Blanketflower is present 
in the mountain and foothill environments of more 
than half of the 23 counties in Wyoming (Rocky 
Mountain Herbarium, 20 11). It does well on a variety 
of soil types, including loams to rocky to gravelly -
sandy textures; and tolerates a soil pH range from 
slightly acidic to mildly alkaline (USDA -NRCS , 
2003). Blanketflower attains optimum growth in full 
sun, beginning in early spring until seed set in late 
summer ( Mueggler and Stewart , 1980). It occurs at 
elevations from 1,300 to 9,000 f eet. 
Establishment  
Blanketflower may be grown from seed or divisio n of 
vegetative parts. The seed does not require cold 
stratification treatment to break dormancy. For range 
plantings, se ed should be planted into a firm, weed -
free seedbed, preferably with a  mechanical drill that 
will ensure uniform seed placement depth o f ¼- to ½ - 
inch.  There are approximately 22 0,700 seeds  in one 
pound of blanketflower. The full seeding rate is 5 
pounds pure live seed  per acre , but it would seldom 
be seeded as  a pure stand. It is recommended that 
blanketflower  be included as a component of a native 
seed mixture at a rate not to exceed ½  to 1 pound 
pure live seed  per acre. When used in a mix,  adjust 
the seeding rate to the desired percentage of mix. 
Spring seeding is preferred over late summer or 
dormant, fall planting date s. 
Management  
Blanketflower is tolerant to drought and requires 
supplemental moisture only during extended hot , dry 
conditions.  Periodic mowing during the 
establishment year is one option for weed 
suppression.  
Pests and Potential Problems  
Blanketflower has no serious insect or disease 
problems. Root rot may be a problem in poorly 
drained soils, especially during extended periods of  heavy rain. Powdery mildew may be present at times 
of elevated humidity, but usually does not have a 
long
-term negative impact on the plants.  The species 
generally is susceptible to aster yellows and fungal 
leaf spot disease (Missouri Botanical Garden, 20 11). 
Gaillardia is slightly susceptible to oat blue dwarf 
virus (Brunt et al., 1996).  
Environmental Concerns  
Blanketflower plants tend to be m oderately long-
lived and may re -seed in abundance. A skin rash or 
irritation may develop following contact with juice or 
sap from the foliage  (eNature,  2011). 
Ecological Considerations  
As global demand increases for drinking and irrigation 
water, there is concern over the excessive use of high 
water -consuming plants in residential and commercial 
landscapes (Proctor, 1996). Blanketflower is an 
attractive, showy, native wildflower that is tolerant of 
drought conditions within its range of adaptation 
(Curtis a nd Curtis, 1989). It is recommended for use as 
an ornamental specimen plant or a mass display in low 
watering zones of Xeriscape™ and waterwise gardens 
(Knopf, 1991). It may be irrigated using non- potable 
water with salinity levels up to 5.4 decisiemens per 
meter with minimal impact to the visual aesthetics of  
the plant (Niu et al., 2007). Blanketflower is considered 
deer -resistant due to the mature plant’s unpalatable and 
rough -textured stems and leaves (Parkinson, 2003). 
Whitetail deer may lightly browse blanketflower to 
supplement dietary needs at different times of the year 
(Atwood, 1941). Low volatility of the leaf chemistry 
combined with high moisture content suggests 
blanketflower  has low flammab ility and may be 
resistant to wildfire (Dennis, 2008). P ercentage canopy 
cover of blanketflower, however, more than doubled 
following a wildfire (Antos et al., 1983). More than 30 
hybrid varieties of several species of blanketflower 
have been developed for use in the commercial 
floriculture industry with the ma jority having 
landscape application in the southern regions of the 
U nited  States . (Hammond, 2007) . 
 
Blanketflower in landscape garden

A wide variety of pollinators and beneficial insects rely 
on blanketflower as a food source of pollen and nectar, 
and for resting and cover. It is a common nectar source 
for the adult stage of the butterfly, Edwards fritillary 
Speyeria edwards (Opler, 2008 ). A cryptic moth, 
Schinia masoni , is color-camouflaged to mimic the 
yellow ray flowers and purplish -brown disk flowers of 
blanketflower as protection against predators (Ferner, 
1981). Blanketflower is an indicator plant associated 
with the upland, dry pra irie habitats of the Dakota 
skipper  Hesperia dacotae  Skinner (Cochrane and 
Delphey, 2002), a butterfly species petitioned as a 
candidate for listing under the Endangered Species Act 
(USDI -USFWS, 2008). In western North America, the 
widely distributed soft -winged flower beetle Listrus 
senilis  is recognized as a crucial pollinator of 
blanketflower (Mawdsley, 2003). Blanketflower is a 
component of several northern grassland ecosystems 
where the breakdown of organic matter by 
functionally -important insects increased soil fertility 
and improved soil water -holding capacity and water 
infiltration (Hewitt and Burleson, 1976).  
 
Honey bees visiting blanketflower  
Indian tribes of North America long recognized the 
medicinal qualities of blanketflower and used it to treat 
many ailments (University of Michigan, 20 11). The 
Blackfeet used infusions of roots and leaves to relieve 
upset stomachs and to treat saddle sores on hors es 
(Larson and Johnson, 1999).  Kiowas picked the 
flowers for good luck (Johnson and Larson, 1999). 
Blanketflower was one of the voucher  specimens 
collected by Captain Meriwether Lewis along the 
Blackfoot River on July 7, 1806 (Phillips, 2003). 
Cancer studies on major plant groups determined 
blanketflower contained the sesquiterpene lactone 
agent, gaillardin, a tumor -killing (antineoplastic) 
compound (Lewis and Elvin -Lewis, 1977).  There is 
evidence blanketflower contains substances with 
antibacterial properties (Harris, 1949). A skin rash or 
irritation may develop following contact with juice or 
sap f rom the foliage (Ferner, 1981).  
The tend er, young plant growth and insect -rich blooms 
of blanketflower are a potential food source for young  and adult upland game birds, such as sage
-grouse and 
sharp -tail grouse. Forage palatability of blanketflower 
is rated poor to fair for domestic livestock during early 
stages of growth. It is a mid -summer maturing species 
in sagebrush plant communities (Pitt and Wikeem, 
1990). Blanketflower can be an indicator of range 
readiness, as it will begin to bloom when more 
desirable forage plants have reached the sta ge of 
growth where they are ready for grazing (WACD, 
1987). Blanketflower was a highly selected forb by 
California bighorn sheep and comprised 2  percent of 
late -summer diet (Wikeem and Pitt, 1979). Gayton 
(2003) indicated grazing regime or local site condi tions 
greatly influence re -growth in blanketflower. Its 
response to grazing and other disturbances can be 
indicators of successional trend and ecological integrity 
( Mueggler , 1983). Light grazing by domestic sheep did 
not noticeably affect the abundance of  plants 
(Daubenmire, 1970). Tyrer et al. (2007) suggest early 
germination and establishment, and resistance to 
allelopathic chemicals, give Gaillardia aristata  
seedlings a considerable advantage over later 
germinating Russian knapweed  Acroptilon repens  (a 
noxious weed) seedlings. Callaway et al. (2004) found 
the biomass of spotted knapweed  Centaurea stoebe 
ssp.  micranthos  (another noxious weed) was lower 
when grown in competition with Gaillardia aristata . 
Plant communities rich in perennial forb species suc h 
as blanketflower, may be more resistant to noxious 
weed invasion (Maron and Marler, 2007) and 
indigenous, deep- rooted, forb functional groups (of 
which  Gaillardia  is a member) capture soil moisture 
and nutrients making them less available for weed 
establ ishment (Pokorny, 2005) .
 
Blanketflower seedheads 
Seed and Plant Production  
Blanketflower lends itself to agronomic seeding 
methods when planted at the appropriate time and 
rate (Norcini, 2006).  Seed production fields should be 
established in rows at 25 pure live seeds per lineal 
foot of row. Between -row spacing is dependent on 
the type of planting and cultivation equipment, and 
ranges from 24 to 36 inches. Adequate between -row 
space should be provided to perform mechanical

cultivation. At 24-inch row spacing, the 
recommended seeding rate is 2.5 pounds pure live 
seed  per  acre, and at 30 - and 36 -inch row spacing, the 
seeding rate is 2.2 and 1.9  pounds pure live seed per 
acre, respectively. There are presently no herbicides 
specifically labeled to control we eds in seed 
production fields of this species. Preliminary results 
in a wildflower seed production herbicide trial 
indicate d effective weed control with the use of 
pendimethalin and a mix of pendimethalin and 
trifluralin (Wiese, 2009) . Seed harvest can be 
accomplished by direct combining when the seeds 
have just begun to shatter from the radiate 
flowerhead. Immediately after combining, spread out 
harvested ma terial to dry and prevent mold.  
 
Meriwether Germplasm blanketflower seed production field , at the 
B ridger  Plant  Materials  Center  
Due to the persistent hairy pappus, and poor seed 
flow, this species is fairly  difficult to clean.  Seeds are 
moderately viable and longevity can be expected for 
several years when stored at favorable temperatures 
and low humid ity. Meriwether Germplasm 
blanketflower yielded approximately 150 bulk 
pounds  of seed per acre in experimental irrigated 
plots at the Bridger P lant Materials  Center  on an 
average harvest date of July 29. Seed production is 
expected to be much higher when grown under 
conventional agronomic conditions.

is a composite of seed collections from 14 Montana 
counties and one county in Wyoming.
