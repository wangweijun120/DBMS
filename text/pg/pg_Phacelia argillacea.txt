There are no known human uses of  Atwood’s 
phacelia.  The stems are eaten by rock squirrels 
(USDI -FWS, 1982) . 
Status 
Atwood’s phacelia was listed as endangered in 1978 
by th e USDI Fish and Wildlife Service (USDI -FWS, 
1978). At the time of listing, the species was known 
from a single population containing nine individuals. 
In 1980 a second population was discovered bringing 
the total number of individuals to approximately 200 
(USDI -FWS, 1982).  In 2005, seed collections and 
germination studies yielded 53 potted plants, which 
subsequently produced 11,000 seeds. These seeds are 
to be used in further studies and reestablishment 
ventures (USDA -FS, 2011).

Description
 
General : Waterleaf family (Hydrophyllaceae). 
Atwood’s phacelia is a w inter annual forb with one to 
several stems. It grows to a height of 36 cm (14 in) 
tall. The leaves are 5 to 25 cm ( 2 to 10 in) long and 
deeply  lobed. The inflorescence is a compound, 
scorpioid cyme (curling like a scorpion’s tail), with 
blue to violet bell- shaped flowers with 4 to 6 mm 
( 0.16 to 0. 24 in) long  petals (Welsh et al., 2003).  
Distribution :    
Atwood’s phacelia is known from two locations  near 
Tucker, Utah in Utah County. Another population, 
from which herbarium specimens were taken in 1883, 
ha s not b een relocated (USDI -FWS, 1982).  
 
For current distribution, consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.  
 
Habitat :  
Atwood’s phacelia is found on shaley -clay slopes in 
pinyon -juniper and mountain brush communities at 
2, 015  m (7,050  ft) elevation . The nearby Soldier 
Summit weather station indicates an average of 35 
cm (14 in) of annual precipitation (WRCC, 2010).  
Adaptation  
Atwood’s phacelia is endemic to clay and shale soils 
of the Green River Formation on east and southeast  
facing slopes. The locations of the two populations, 
though high in elevation, are considered to be on  
xeric sites because of the steepness and exposure 
(USDI -FWS, 1982).  
Management  
The existing populations of Atwood’s phacelia are 
located on private property owned by the D&G RGW 
Railroad. The primary threat to the species is habitat 
destruction due to construction activities by the 
railroad company. A major goal in the recovery effort 
is to establish new populations on publically owned 
lands that can receive a higher level of protection 
(USDA -FS, 2010).  The objective of the recovery plan 
is to establish a self -sustaining population of 2,000 to 
3,000 individuals on 120 acres of protected habitat, 
and to possibly establish at least one new population 
(USDI -FWS, 1982).
