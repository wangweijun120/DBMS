Alternate Names 
Fremont’s clematis, Fremont’s crowsfoot, Fremont’s 
leather-plant, leatherplant, rattleweed 
 
Uses 
Ornamental :  Fremont’s leather flower has potential 
as a garden plant with its unique, showy, bell or urn-
shaped flowers, ornamental fruit clusters, interesting 
texture and long period of attractiveness (Locklear 
1991).  It may be planted in large groups and is an 
attractive addition to rock  gardens, border fronts, 
native plant gardens, prairies or meadows (Easyliving 
Wildflowers, 2008).  Fremont’s leather flower 
combines well with other native herbaceous spring 
bloomers, such as pasque flower and prairie smoke 
(Hendrickson and Browning 2008).     
 
Status 
Described as one of our rarest plants, Fremont’s 
leather flower is protect ed in Missouri (FGCM, 
2009).  Please consult the PLANTS Web site and 
your State Department of Natural Resources for this 
plant’s current status (e.g. threatened or endangered 
species, state noxious stat us, and wetland indicator 
values). 
  Description 
General
: An herbaceous perennial, non-climbing, 
shrubby-type clematis, with broad ovate leathery 
green leaves to 5 inches long with parallel veins, 
appearing alternate, simple, and sessile, on erect 
stems 12 to 24 inches tall, arising from a stout caudex 
bearing many fibrous roots.  Thick, non-spreading, 
often recurved sepals form an inch-long solitary bell-
shaped purple to white flower nodding on a slender 
stalk atop the foliage.  Blooming occurs late April 
into June, giving rise to large clusters of achenes each 
tipped with a long, curled style.  The achenes and 
foliage turn brown in the fall and persist into the 
winter (Locklear, 1991; Missouri Botanical Garden, 
2008). 
 
Distribution :  Fremont’s leather flower has been 
found in 15 counties in north central Kansas and 3 
adjoining counties in south central Nebraska 
according to herbarium records (McGregor and 
Barkley, 1977) and 7 counties in Missouri, 6 
clustered in east central Missouri, and 1 located in 
Ozark County (Steyermark, 1963).  The Missouri 
populations have been described as the distinct  C. f . 
var. riehlii , though there is presently little support for 
this (Barkley, 1986).  A recent discovery from 
Tennessee near Chattanoog a in 2006 and a nearby 
Georgia population has been reported (TNPS, 2007).  
For current distribution,  please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site. 
 
Habitat: Fremont’s leather flower is native to 
limestone prairies and dolomite glades.    
 
Adaptation   
Fremont’s leather flower thrives in full sun on a lean 
alkaline soil (Barr 1983).  Although this species 
naturally occurs on rocky prairie sites such as Fort 
Hays Limestone and Smoky Hill Chalk (Bare 1979), 
and on limestone glades in the eastern Ozark region 
(Easyliving Wildflowers, 2008), it has been found to 
be a hardy, very easy to grow, long lived garden plant 
given full sun to part shade and rich, well drained soil 
(Hendrickson and Browning 2008).  This species is 
adapted to the 20 to 24 inch precipitation zone 
(Locklear, 1991). 
 
Establishment 
Seed may be sown following a three month cold-
moist stratification period.  The seeds are slow to 
germinate and may lay in the soil medium a month 
before germinating.  Planting on well-drained soils is

required for successful establishment (Locklear, 
1991).

Seeds and Plant Production 
There are approximately 35,290 seeds per pound 
(USDA NRCS, 2009).  Plants grown from seed take 
two to three years to reach maturity and begin 
flowering (Locklear, 1991).
