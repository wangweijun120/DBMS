ses  
Shivwits  milkvetch is highly palatable to domestic 
livestock (USDI -FWS, 2006a ). The plants have also  
been observed being grazed by deer, often consuming 
the entire inflorescence (Welsh, 2003).  There are no 
known human uses of the species.  
Status 
Shivwits  milkvetch was listed as endangered in 2001 
due to its rarity and declining populations  (USDI-
FWS, 2001), and in 2006, the US DI Fish and 
Wildlife Service designated approximately 2,151 
acres as critical habitat (USDI -FWS, 2006b ).

 escription
 
General : Legume  family ( Fabaceae).  Shivwits  
milkvetch is a perennial forb growing 20 to 65 cm (8 
to 26 in) tall from a branching subterranean root 
crown.  The stems are spreading to erect, bearing 
pinnately compound leaves , 5 to 22 cm (2 to 9 in) 
long with 13 to 21 leaflets. The leaflets are 4 to 24 
mm ( 0.16 to 1.0 in) long, and 3 to 15 mm ( 0.12 to 
0.59  in) wide. The inflorescence is a raceme  with 20 
to 45  cream yellow colored flowers. The flowers are 
14 to 18 mm (0.55 to 0.71 in) long. The fruit is an 
elliptical, inflated pod, 12 to 18 mm (0.47 to 0.71 in) 
long,  and 8 to 10 mm (0.31 to 0.39 in)  thick (Welsh 
et al., 2003).  
 
Distribution :    
There are six know n populations of Shivwits 
milkvetch distributed across a limited range. All 
known populations occur within Washington County, 
Utah , ranging from Pahcoon Spring Wash, 
approximately  18 km (11 mi) northwest of St. George 
to  Rockeville, Utah, approximately 64  km (40 mi ) to 
the east of the Pahcoon Spring Wash population 
(USDI -FWS, 2006a ). 
 
For current distribution, consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.  
 
Habitat :  
Shivwits  milkvetch grows in the Mojave Desert in 
creosote  (Larrea  tridentata ) and  Utah  juniper 
( Juniperus osteosperma) plant communities with 
other warm desert shrubs.  
 
Adaptation  
Shivwits  milkvetch is restricted to isolated pockets of 
gypsiferous soils of the Chinle formation from 900 to 
1350 m (3,000 to 4,360 ft) in el evation in an area 
receiving an average of 16.5 cm (6.5 in) of annual 
precipitation  (WRCC, 2011).  
 
Management  
The major threats to Shivwits  milkvetch involve 
habitat loss as a result of human disturbance. U rban 
and commercial development s urrounding the St. 
George area, including the creation of r oads, power 
transmission lines, and water  pipelines, have 
significantly impacted milkvetch habitat . Off -road 
vehicle (ORV)  use  and cattle  grazing and trampling 
continue to threaten Shivwits  milkvetch.  The clay 
so ils  creating  Shivwits  milkvetch habitat lack 
stabilit y and are easily disturbed.  Fencing of USDI -

BLM managed populations will reduce ORV and 
cattle impacts. A further threat comes from the 
increase in fire frequency due to invasive non -native 
grasses such as cheatgrass ( Bromus tectorum) and red 
brome ( Bromus rubens ) (USDI -FWS, 2006a) . 
 
The current recovery plan for Shivwits  milkvetch 
includes fire and fuels management including a 1.2 
km (0.75 mi) buffer zone surrounding known 
populations. Signs and fencing have also been 
installed at several of the population sites to reduce 
ORV, cattle , and human trampling (USDI -FWS, 
2006a) .  
 
Pests and Potential Problems  
Herbivory from livestock, deer and rabbits are a 
concern for this species. Additionally, aphid 
infestations and infestations of white moths have 
been documented (USDI -FWS, 2006a ). It is 
unknown what, if any, impacts these pests have on 
the fecundity of the plants.  
 
Environmental Concerns  
There are no known environmental concerns  
associated with Shivwits  milkvetch . 
 
Seed and Plant Production  
Flowering occurs from April to May, with each plant 
bearing approximately 90 flowers.  Shivwits  
milkvetch can be fertilized via pollinators or through 
self -fertilization; h owever, studies indicate that self -
fertilized fruit bear significantly less seed  than insect 
pollinated flowers (Tepedino, 2005). Several native 
bees have been observed p ollinating Shivwits 
milkvetch including: Anthophora coptognatha, A. 
dammersi, Eucera quadricinata, Bombus morrisoni, 
Osmia clarescens, O. marginata, and O. titusi. 
Pollination by European honeybees ( Apis millifera) 
has  also  been documented (Tepedino, 2005) . No 
horticultural  propagation information is available.
