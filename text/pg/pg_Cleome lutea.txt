Uses  
Pollinator:  Yellow  beeplant  is a valuable native  forage 
species for bees wasps and butterflies. Over 140 species 
of native bees have  been observed foraging for nectar or 
pollen on yellow beeplant in southern Utah (Cane, 2008). 
Yellow beeplant is an annual forb which could provide 
food to insects in the first growing season of a range 
seeding (Ogle and others, 2011a). This available food 
source could sustain pollinators until perennial forb 
species produce flowers, typically in the second growing 
season.  
 
Range revegetation:  Yellow beeplant has potential for use 
in range seedings throughout the arid to semi -arid  regions 
of the Intermount ain West. It provides little to no forage 
to large mammals, and its sparse stems provide  limited  cover to small vertebrates. The seeds are likely eaten by 
birds and rodents. Its primary value is as a pollinator food 
source.
 
 
Ethnobotanical:  Yellow beeplant was used in ceremonial 
medicine by the Navajo and Kayenta peoples. It was also 
used as a dermatological aid for ant bites (Moerman, 
1998). Some Plateau Indian tribes used the stems and 
flowers to create an infusion for a treatment for cold 
(Hunn, 1990).

Description  
General :  Formerly pla ced in the Caper family 
(Capparaceae) but now considered an early offshoot of 
the cabbage family (Brassicaceae). Yellow beeplant is a 
tap rooted annual forb. It has one to several branched or 
simple erect stems reaching 0.3 to 1.5 m (60 in) in height. 
The  leaves are palmate with 3 to 5 oblong to lanceolate 
leaflets, each leaflet 1 to 5 cm (0.4 to 2.0 in) long and 2 to 
10 mm (0.08 to 0.4 in) wide. The inflorescence is a 
terminal indeterminate raceme. The flowers are similar to 
those found in the mustard fami ly (Brassicaceae). They 
have four petals, four sepals, 6 stamens and the fruit is a 
two -valved silique. The petals are yellow, approximately 
6 mm (0.25 in) long (Spellenberg, 1994). The stamens, 
unlike those in the mustard family, are long and greatly 
exer ted from the flower. The fruit also differs from a 
mustard fruit in that the pod sits atop a 6 to 12 mm (0.25 
to 0.5 in) long stalk or stipe (Welsh and others 2003). The 
pod is 1 to 4 cm (0.4 to 1.6 in) long and bears 
approximately 8, 2 to 4 mm (0.08 to 0. 16 in) diameter 
seeds (Cane, 2008). Seed counts range from 150,000 to 
220,000 seeds/kg (70,000 to 100,000 seeds/lb) (Cane, 
2008; USDA -NRCS, 2011).  
 
Yellow beeplant plants produced two types of flowers, 
hermaphroditic and staminate (Cane, 2008). The 
staminate flower s begin as hermaphroditic buds , but the 
pistil fails to completely form. Racemes alternate between 
staminate and hermaphroditic flower production 
(Murneek, 1937). When the raceme is laden with 
developing fruit, the plant switches to stamina te flower 
production. This allows the plant to produce fruit 
indeterminately throughout  the blooming period (Cane, 
2008).

rotundata) can be  utilized for pollination of  seed 
production fields.  
 
Fruit and seed of yellow beeplant ripen indeterminately. 
This poses difficulties in harvesting seed for maximum 
yield. Yields of mat ure seed can be increased by leaving 
swathed plants to dry for a week before harvesting seed. 
Seed can also be harvested by hand or by using a vacuum -
type harvester.  
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin)  
Common wildland collecte d seed is available through 
commercial sources. There are currently no commercial 
releases of  yellow beeplant.
