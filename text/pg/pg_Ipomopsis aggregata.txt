SCARLET GILIA  
Ipomopsis aggregata  (Pursh) V.E. Grant 
Plant Symbol =  IPAG 
Common Names:  Skyr ocket, skunkflower, scarlet trumpet flower  
Scientific Names:  Gilia aggregata, Cantua aggregata  
Description  
General : Phlox  Family ( Polemoniaceae).  Scarlet gilia is a biennial  to 
short -lived perennial  forb arising from a basal rosette and taproot.  
Individual plants remain in rosette form for one to many years and 
typically die after flowering  (Fertig, 2017).   The Scarlet giliaâ€™s 
lifespan varies, but o ne study found an average lifespan of 4.8 years 
w ith no plants surviving after ten years (Campbel , 1997) .  In 
production trials conducted at Rocky Mountain Research Station, the 
proportion of plants beh aving as biennials was approximately  99%. A 
very few were noted as possibly  carry ing over to the following year, 
but those  may  have been  seed that germinated a year later  (Jensen, 
2017) . Mature plants can reach as much as 1  m (3 ft) tall, but plants 
typically range from 0.5 to 0.6  m (18 to 24 in) in height. The basal 
leaves are 2 to 8 cm ( 0.8 to 3.1 in) long and highly pinnatifid with 
narrow segments. The stem leaves reduce further up the st em. The 
flowers are typically scarlet as  in varieties aggregata, arizonica and 
maculat a, but can be white, salmon or pink in variety macrosiphon. 
Flowers are long tubular (1.5 to 5 cm long) with five spreading petals. 
The fruit is a 5 to 10 mm ( 0.2 to 0.4 in) capsule bearing 1 to several , 2 to 4 mm long seeds. As is typical in the phlox family, 
the seeds become mucilaginous (slimy) when wet (Welsh et al., 2003).  Jensen (2017) reported that from 36 collections ,  seed 
weights  range d from 280,000 to 700,000  seeds/lb . 
Distribution :  Scarlet gilia is  located throughout western North America from Montana south to T exas and west to British 
Columbia south to California. For current distribution, please consult the 
Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.   
Adaptation  
Scarlet gilia  is typically found in sunny openings in mountain shrub, 
sagebrush steppe, and alpine tim ber communities from 1,100 to 3,300  m 
( 3,600 to 10,800 ft ) elevations in the Sierra, Intermountain and Rocky 
Mountain regions (Hickman, 1993; Welsh et al., 2003).   It is very drought 
tolerant,  shade  intolerant, and has higher germination success and seedling 
survival  in disturbed soils  (Juenger and Bergelson,  2000) .  Scarlet gilia 
prefers medium to coarse loam to sandy loam soils  in areas receiving 250 
to 1 ,000 mm (10  t o 40 in) mean annual precipitation.    
Uses  
W ildlife : Scarlet gilia can be included in conservation and wildlife habitat plantings to increase species diversity.  Plants are 
highly palatable,  with the flowering stocks regularly utilized by native wildlife and livestock  (Fertig, 2017).  The timing of 
herbivory can influence plant response, with overcompensation  (increased flower and seed production compared to non-
grazed plants)  observed  with early season herbivory  and reduced flowers and seed production with late season herbivory  
( Paige and Whitham, 1987; Paige 1999).    
 
Pollinator : Hummingbirds  and bumblebees  are attracted to this showy species from which they extract nectar  (Irwin, 1998) .

should be applied to the top of the planting soil to prevent seeds from floating during watering. Conetainers should be  
watered deeply and placed outside  before being moved to the greenhouse in early to mid -January. Alternately, seed can be 
moist stratified in a refrigerator for 45 days before sowing in the greenhouse.   Emergence may begin in four to eight days and 
it may take two weeks for the seedling to become established.  Once established, the plant enters and active growing phase 
and should remain in the green house for three months .  Watering deeply should occur daily and a water soluble fertilizer 
should be added weekly .  Hardening can take place in late March or early April depending on the weather.  Plants can be 
moved into a cold frame and watered every other day when cool, every day when hot.   Hardening may take two to four weeks 
and the plant should be ready for transplant by early May (Skinner, 2007).   
 
Stem cuttings can be propagated in a frame (Mirov & Kraebel 1939).  
Cultivars , Improved, and Selected Materials (and area of origin)   
Limited quantities of w ildland collected seed may be  available from commercial sources. There are currently no commercial 
releases of scarlet gilia . Seed sources  should be selected based on the local climate, resistance to local pests, and intended 
use. Consult with your local land grant universit y, local extension or local USDA NRCS office for recommendations for use 
in your area .
