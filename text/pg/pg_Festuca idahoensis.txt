Uses 
Grazing/rangeland/wildlife:  Idaho fescue is a fair to 
good forage for all types of domestic livestock 
(Stubbendieck, J. et al., 1992).  It is good year-around 
forage for elk and is grazed in spring by deer. Idaho 
fescue begins senescence later in the growing season 
than most other range plants. Therefore, it is 
particularly useful for late season grazing.  The 
“Range Plant Handbook” prepared by the USDA, 
Forest Service includes a lengthy discussion on Idaho 
fescue use as rangeland forage (USDA, Forest 
Service,1988).  We reprint this discussion below. 
 
“Idaho fescue is abundant and sometimes the 
dominant plant on extensive areas. It usually 
ranks with the choicest forage plants, and in  
Montana and possible elsewhere is, everything 
considered, probably the best forage grass.  However, 
it may not quite merit first rank in palpability in some 
sections.  It produces a fair amount of seed of 
comparatively high viability and maintains itself well 
on the range if given a reasonable opportunity.  Idaho 
fescue excels many of its as sociated forage species in 
ability to withstand heavy grazing and trampling, 
although it will succumb to continued grazing abuse.   All classes of livestock relish it in the spring, as well 
as later in the season where it grows on north slopes 
or in cooler, moister sites and where the herbage 
remains tender.  Under such conditions it is often 
grazed more closely than other associated grasses.  
As the season advances, the plants tend to become 
somewhat tough and harsh, and less succulent, with a 
proportionate decrease in palatability for sheep, 
especially ewes and lambs; to some extent this is true 
for horses and cattle also.  However, if more inviting 
forage is not available, livestock will graze this 
species throughout the season and thrive.  Moreover, 
the plant cures well on the ground and makes a good 
or very good fall forage, being readily grazed by all 
classes of livestock until late in the season, while it 
also produces a good aftermath, which is much 
relished.  When accessible it is also a good forage for 
winter use.”

California Rangelands Native Grasses 
Borman et al., (1991) compared eleven perennial 
grasses for their ability to suppress growth of resident 
annuals in southwest Oregon.  Both Idaho fescue and 
‘Berber’ orchardgrass ( Dactylis glomerata), which 
begin growth early in the spring, suppressed annuals 
more effectively that grasses which initiate growth 
later in the spring.  The grasses in this study, that 
initiated growth later in the spring compared to Idaho 
fescue and Berber orchardgrass, are California 
oatgrass ( Danthonia  californica ), prairie junegrass 
( Koeleria macrantha ), tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum 
elongatum ), intermediate wheatgrass ( Thinopyrum. 
intermedium ‘  Oahe’), tall fescue ( Lolium 
arundinacea ), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne ), 
Rush intermediate wheatgrass ( Thinopyrum. 
intermedium  ‘Rush’), and orchardgrass ( Dactylis 
glomerata ‘ Paiute’).  The authors suggest that, for 
reseeding in the southern Oregon foothills, land 
managers should select grass species, which initiate 
the earliest spring growth, and maintain some growth 
though out the winter. 
   
Moderate continuous grazing (33% current herbage 
used) did not reduce vigor of Idaho fescue in a 5-year 
grazing study (Ratliff and Reppert (1974).  However, 
they further reported that continuous grazing unduly 
subjects the plants to heavy pressure during dry 
years.  Jacobs and Sheley  (1996) compared several 
Idaho fescue defoliation frequencies and defoliation 
levels (percents of aboveground biomass removed) 
for the ability of Idaho fe scue to interfere with 
spotted knapweed ( Centaurea maculosa  Lam.) 
emergence and growth. As the Idaho fescue

defoliation frequency and defoliation level decreased 
spotted knapweed emergence and growth also 
decreased.  The authors suggest that moderate 
grazing intensity and infrequent grazing will 
minimize spotted knapweed invasions by maximizing 
soil water use by Idaho fescue.  
 
Idaho fescue produces an extensive, deep root 
system.  Therefore, it is an excellent erosion control 
grass for cutover forest areas (Hafenrichter et al., 
1968).  Plants that develop root-mycorrhizal 
associations are more tolerant of adverse soil 
conditions.  Ho (1987) identified mycorrhizal Idaho 
fescue plants growing in an alkali dry lake bed.  This 
alkaline environment (pH 9.2 to 10.5) is not a typical 
Idaho fescue habitat.  Mycorrhiza innoculation may 
hold promise for increasing the vigor and range of 
adaptation of Idaho fescue.  
 
Erosion control/reclamation: Idaho fescue is fairly 
drought resistant, stands are persistent and it is 
adapted to stabilization of disturbed soils.  It does not 
compete well with aggressive introduced grasses.  Its 
drought tolerance, combined with extensive root 
systems and good seedling vigor, make this species 
ideal for reclamation in areas receiving 14 to 20 
inches annual precipitation.

Description 
Idaho fescue is a native, perennial, cool-season grass.  
Idaho fescue culms are erect, 0.3 to 1.0 m tall, 
glabrous and glaucous, sparsely leaved with most 
leaves basal.  The fine narrow leaves usually have a 
bluish green to green color.  The leaf sheaths are 
flattened, keeled, either glabrous or scabrous; the 
basal sheaths are short, open and wider than the 
blade. The sheath collars are indistinct and the 
auricles are either small or absent.  The blades are 
involute, 5 to 25 cm long, filiform, firm, elongate, 
scabrous, often glaucous, glabrous abaxially and 
pubescent adaxially.  The ligule has a ciliate 
membrane, less than 2 mm long, and is truncate.  The 
inflorescence is a panicle, 7 to 15 cm long, narrow, 
dense, with branches asce nding and lower branches 
spreading.  The spikelets are 4 to 7 flowered, 8 to 14 
mm long, with rachilla joints visible; the lemma is 5 
to 7 mm long, somewhat laterally compressed at 
maturity, and scabrous to glabrous.  The lemma is 
awned from the tip, 2 to 5 mm long, and straight. The 
glumes are unequal, lanceo late and acute; the first  glume is 1-nerved, 3 to 5 mm long; and the second 
glume faintly 5-nerved, 4 to 4.5 mm long.  Idaho 
fescue begins growth early in the spring and its seeds 
mature by midsummer. It reproduces from both seeds 
and tillers. 
 
Distribution 
The range of Idaho fescue extends to California, 
Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, South 
Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.  Idaho 
fescue is one of the most common and widely 
distributed grasses in the Western States.  However, 
it is either rare or absent in the southern portions of 
the western states. For current distribution, please 
consult the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site. 
 
Adaptation 
Idaho fescue occupies very diversified habitats.  
Collections show altitudinal variation in Idaho fescue 
habitat extending from 300 m to 4,000 m ( 984 ft. to 
13,120 ft.).  Although it may be found at any 
elevation between these extr
emes, it is most prevalent 
from about 1,524 to 2439 m (5,000 to 8,000 ft.) in 
Montana, from 2,341 to 3049 m (7,000 to 10,000 ft.) 
in Utah and Colorado, and form 915 to 2,341 m 
(3,000 to 7,000 ft.) in California and the Northwest.   
 
It grows on all exposures and under a wide variety of 
soil conditions.  It prefers silt loam or sandy loam 
soils and is occasionally found on loamy sand soils.  
Exposed benchlands, hillsides and ridges, parks, 
meadows, forestlands, and open ponderosa and 
lodgepole pine stands are common habitats. Idaho 
fescue is tolerant of weakly saline, weakly alkaline 
and acidic soil conditions.  
 
It has excellent cold tolerance, moderate drought 
tolerance, and moderate shade tolerance.  It is not as 
drought tolerant as sheep fescue and its drought 
tolerance is similar to that of hard fescue.  It is fairly 
tolerant of fire in autumn, but requires 2 to 3 years to 
fully recover after burning.  It is not tolerant of high 
water tables or flooding.  Its frequent associates 
include bluegrass, mountain brome, geranium, 
yarrow, mountain sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, 
ponderosa pine, bluebunch wheatgrass and slender 
wheatgrass.  In the mountains of Idaho, Montana and 
Wyoming it seems to be replaced by bluebunch 
wheatgrass and needlegrass ( Stipa, Hesperostipa, 
Nassella ) as moisture decreases or overgrazing 
increases.  
 
Establishment 
Natural establishment:  Idaho fescue produces a fair 
amount of seed of comparatively high viability and

maintains itself well on the range if given a 
reasonable opportunity (USDA, Forest Service, 
1988). 
 
Planting: One PLS pound of Idaho fescue seed 
contains approximately 425,000 to 460,000 seeds and 
a broadcast planting of one pound of Idaho fescue 
seed results in a seeding distribution of 
approximately 10.1 seeds per square foot (USDA, 
NRCS, 1996).  The recommended pure stand seeding 
rate is 3 to 4 (PLS) pounds per acre for range 
seedings.  Planting 6 to 8 pounds per acre will 
provide dense cover for erosion control (Ensign et al. 
1984).  Idaho fescue is  normally recommended as 
component, in seeding mixtures, with other native 
species. 
 
Idaho fescue seed is not highly germinable compared 
to alternative forage or competing weeds (Evans and 
Young, 1972).  Cold temperature (2C constant) 
germination 18%, pales in comparison to cheatgrass, 
which had 76% germination under the same 
conditions (Evans and Young 1972, Young et al. 
1981).  Proper weed control coupled with good 
seedbed preparation is needed to achieve dense 
stands of Idaho fescue.   
 
Idaho fescue initiates growth in March through April 
and matures in mid to late summer.  With adequate 
moisture, Idaho will produce a moderate amount of 
re-growth following seed maturity.  Late fall 
plantings are most successful.  Plant early in the 
spring if fall planting is not possible.  Seeded stands 
require 2 to 3 years to establish, but are very 
competitive once established. Recommended planting 
depth is 0.25 to 0.50 inches in fine to medium 
textured soil and no more than 0.75 inches in course 
textured soil.  Conduct a soil analysis before planting; 
if the soil test indicates less than 6 ppm of 
phosphorus, and then apply 60 pounds per acre of 
P
2O5 (Ensign et al. 1984).  Idaho fescue does not 
require or respond to heavy nitrogen applications. 
 
Management 
Idaho fescue is susceptible to overgrazing.  Idaho 
fescue should be left un-grazed by livestock through 
the growing season every 3 to 4 years.  This will 
promote vigor and seed production and encourage the 
development of a strong root system, which is 
beneficial in reducing soil erosion and weed 
competition.  Also, deferred grazing during the 
growing season supplies dry forage for autumn and 
winter use.   
  At least 50%, by weight of Idaho fescue annual 
growth should remain following grazing, or a stubble 
height of about 2 to 3 inches.   
 
Following fire, protect Idaho fescue from grazing for 
two full growing seasons.  An additional year's 
deferment may be needed to achieve full plant 
recovery, and to re-establish a suitable stubble height 
because palatability increases
 significantly following 
fire.  A less palatable residue is desirable to prevent 
livestock for grazing too closely. 
 
Pests 
Primary pests of Idaho fescue are grasshoppers, 
rodents and fungi that produce damping-off diseases 
of seedlings. 
 
Seed Production 
Commercial seed production fields of Idaho fescue 
usually yield no seed the first (establishment) year, a 
limited amount of seed the second year, a large 
amount of seed the third year, and either a low or 
adequate amount of seed  the fourth year (personal 
communication with Grasslands West Company, 
Clarkston, Washington, U.S.A.).   
 
For seed production, plant Idaho fescue seed in early 
autumn in a firm, weed free, fertile soil at a depth of 
0.25 inches.  Row spacing of 30 to 36 inches is 
recommended to facilitate weed control and rouging 
of off-types.  Plant 4 PLS (pure live seed) pounds of 
seed per acre for  these row plantings (Ensign et al. 
1984). 
 
Cultivars, Improved and Selected Materials (and 
area of origin) 
Foundation and registered seed is available through 
the appropriate state Crop  Improvement Association 
or commercial sources to  grow certified seed. 
 
Idaho fescue characteristically has poor seed 
production and weak seedling vigor (Hafenrichter et 
al. 1968).  Therefore, the Un iversity of Idaho initiated 
a breeding program in 1950 to produce Idaho fescue 
cultivars with improved seed set, larger seed size 
(seedling vigor), and improved germination 
percentage.  
 
The University of Idaho Agricultural Experiment 
Station developed two Idaho fescue cultivars 
‘Joseph’ and 'Nezpurs' (Ensing, 1984).  The 
experiment station released both cultivars for 
certification in 1983.  Both Joseph and Nezpurs are 
synthetic cultivars selected through three cycles of 
phenotypic recurrent selection.  The base population 
used for recurrent selection consisted of seed derived

from inter-crossing 89 native ecotypes collected from 
northwestern states of the U.S. and Canada.  Joseph 
is a 13-clone synthetic cultivar.  Joseph exhibited 
18% better seed set, 37% larger seeds, 14% better 
germination compared to th e original native ecotype 
collection.  “It has uniform, robust plants ranging 
from 72 to 80 cm in height.  Joseph is 12 to 18 cm 
taller than ‘Covar’ sheep fescue ( Festuca ovina L.) 
and approximately equal in height to ‘Durar’ hard 
fescue ( Festuca ovina  var. duriuscula ) (Table 1).  
The culms are erect with basal growth and 46% more 
forage production than Covar or Durar.  Seed 
production of Joseph is 30% more than Covar, but 
40% less than Durar” (Ensing, 1984).  Both cultivars are adapted to Idaho, Washington, 
Oregon, Montana and Colorado rangeland and open 
forestland with elevation between 300 and 2700 m 
(984 to 8856 ft.) and annual precipitation between 35 
and 76 cm (13.8 to 29.9 in). 
 
‘Winchester germplasm’ is a source-identified release 
that was made by Jerry Benson (Benson Farms Inc.).  
It originates from near Wi
nchester, Idaho (approx. 
elev. 4000’, ~18” MAP).  It  is identical to P-6435, an 
accession collected and evaluated by the Pullman 
PMC.  ‘Winchester germplasm’ displays a fairly high 
degree of phenotypic vari ability because no effort 
was made to refine the germplasm by removing off-
types.  It is well suited for plantings that require raw 
germplasm. 
 
 ‘Nezpurs’ is a 90-clone synthetic cultivar.  ‘Nezpurs’ 
exhibited 30% more seed se
t, 29% larger seed size, 
and 11% better germination than the original 
collections. Nezpurs is more variable than ’Joseph’.
