Uses  
Said to have a superior flavor to the cultivated 
cranberry ( Vaccinium macrocarpon) (Shepard 1855;  
Eastwood 1856), large quantities of the tart berries 
were gathered in the fall by tribes of the Great Lakes 
region such as the Menomini and Potawatomi (Smith 
1923;  Smith  1933), tribes of the Northeast such as the 
Iroquois and Lenape (Stout 1914; Waugh 1916), the 
Inuit of Alaska (Trehane 2004), the Chinook of 
Oregon, and the Makah, Klallam, Hoh, Quileute, 
Quinault, and Chemakum of western Washington 
(Gunther 1973; Hedrick 1972; Eells 1996; Archibald 
1999). The First Nations of Canada, such as the 
Haida, Kwa kwa
ka'wakw, and other cultural groups 
also relished the berries (Turner 2004; U'mista 
Cultural Society et al. 1998). Because the berries last 
through the winter and preserve well under the snow, 
they could also be gathered in spring as was done by 
the Dena 'ina of south -central Alaska and the Woods 
Cree of Canada (Kari 1987; Leighton 1985). Even 
though they are small, the importance of these berries 
to many indigenous cultures should not be 
underestimated. The fact that the month of September 
is connected wi th "the season for cranberries" in the 
Makah lunar calendar underscores the importance of  these fruits in their food economy (Waterman 1920). 
 
 
Small cranberries were gathered wild in England and 
Scotland and made into tarts, marmalade, jelly, jam, 
and added to puddings and pies (Eastwood 1856). 
Many colonists were already familiar with this fruit 
in Great Britain before finding it in North America. 
The small cranberry helped stock the larder of 
English and American ships, fed trappers in remote 
regions, and pleased the palates of Meriwether Lewis 
and William Clark in their explorations across the 
United States (Lewis and  Clark 1 965). The Chinook, 
for example, traded dried cranberries with the 
English vessel Ruby in 1795 and at Thanksgiving in 
1805 Lewis and Clark dined on venison, ducks, 
geese, and small cranberry sauce from fruit brought 
by Chinook women (McDonald 1966; Lewis and 
Clark 1965). Beca use the small cranberry can grow in 
association with large cranberry ( Vaccinium 
macrocarpon) in the Great Lakes region, northeastern 
USA and southeastern Canada (Boniello 1993; Roger 
Latham pers. comm.  2009) it is possible that the 
Pilgrims of Plymouth wer e introduced to both edible 
species by the Wampanoag.  
 
The berries are still gathered today in the United 
States, Canada, and Europe (Himelrick 2005). The 
Makah, Quinault, and Quileute of the Olympic 
Peninsula still gather them every fall and non -Indians 
f rom early settler families still gather them (Anderson 
2009). Small cranberries are an important source of 
phenolic compounds, especially anthocyanins, that 
show high anti -oxidant potential (Kahkonen et al. 
2001; Kahkonen et al. 1999). They are an excellen t 
source of flavonols, having higher concentrations 
than apples (Himelrick 2005).  
 
There were many indigenous ways to prepare and eat 
cranberries. Berries could be eaten fresh, boiled, 
baked in a pit, dried or stored for future use, and in 
later times they  were canned and used for making 
jams, jellies, and pies (Gill 1984; Olson 1936). In 
western Washington, the berries were usually stored 
in boxes or baskets until soft and brown (Gunther 
1973). For example, among the Quileute on the 
Olympic Peninsula cranb erries either sat in storage 
until they became soft, or they were crushed and 
eaten with grease (Powell and Morganroth 1998). 
The Potawatomi and the Menomini of Wisconsin 
sweetened the berries with maple sugar (Smith 1933; 
Smith 1923). The Menomini dried t hem in the sun for 
winter use and ate dried cranberries and dried sweet 
corn together, sweetened with maple sugar (Smith 
1923). In the Northeastern United States, pemmican
