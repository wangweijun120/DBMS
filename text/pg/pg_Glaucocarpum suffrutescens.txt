U

ses  
Uinta Basin  waxfruit is grazed by rabbits,  horses, 
sheep and cattle (USDI -FWS, 1987). There are no 
known human uses of this species.  
Status 
Uinta  Basin  waxfruit was listed as an endangered 
species in 1987 due to its restricted range and number 
of individuals, and  its vulnerability to habitat 
disturbance  (USDI-FWS, 1987). At that time, it was 
proposed to designate critical habitat for the species. 
The proposal was however withdrawn, because it was 
believed that designated critical habitat would expose 
the populatio n to a significant risk of vandalism 
(USDI -FWS, 1987).   
 
   
This species has also been treated historically 
as a 
member of the genera  Schoenocrambe and 
Thelypodium ; however, Al -Shehbaz (2005), and 
subsequently, the Flora of North America, combined 
Glaucocarpum,  and much of Schoenocrambe  into the 
larger genus Hesperidanthus.  This change has not yet 
been adopted by the PLANTS database or USDI Fish 
and Wildlife Service.

Description  
General : Mustard  family ( Brassicaceae).  Uinta Basin 
waxfruit is a perennial subshrub with multiple stems 
arising from a woody caudex.   The plants grow to a 
height of 10 to 35 cm (4 to 14  in). It has sessile or 
petiolate leaves with a smooth margin, 10 to 25 mm 
(0.39 to 1.0 in) long and 3 to 10 mm (0.12 to 0.39 in) 
wide. The  inflorescence is a raceme with 5 to 20 
yellow four -petaled flowe rs, with petals 7 to 11 mm 
( 0.28 to 0.43 in) long. The fruit is  a silique (a 
lengthened pod), 10 to 20 mm (0.39 to 0.79 in)  long 
by 1.2 to 2.5 mm (0.05 to 0.10 in) thick. The seeds 
are 1.5 to 1.9 mm ( 0.06 to 0.07 in) long by 0.9 to 1.3 
mm ( 0.4 to 0.5 in) t hick. 
 
Distribution : 
There are three known populations of  Uinta Basin 
waxfruit. The Gray Knolls population sits between 
the Green River and Hill Creek in Uintah County, 
Utah, and contains approximately 1,000 plants in 
three stands. The second population is  on Little Pack 
Mountain and Big Pack Mountain between Hill 
Creek and Willow Creek in Uintah County, Utah and 
is comprised of approximately 3,000 plants in six 
stands. The third population is in Duchesne County, 
Utah at the base of the Bad Lands Cliff with  
approximately  1,000 scattered plants. The lands 
occupied by Uinta Basin waxfruit are  managed by the 
USID -BLM, the Uintah and Ouray Reservation of the 
Ute Indian Tribe , and the Naval Oil Shale Reserve 
No. 2 administered by the Department of Energy 
(USDI -FW S, 1994).  
 
For current distribution, consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.

Habitat:  
Uinta Basin waxfruit occurs in desert shrub 
communities with interspersed pinyon ( Pinus edulis) 
and juniper ( Juniperus osteosperma).  The dominant 
species of the habitat include shadscale ( Atriplex 
confertifolia ), pygmy sagebrush (Artemisia  
pygmaea), mountain mahogany ( Cercocarpus 
montanus ), Salina widlrye ( Elymus salina) and 
jointfir ( Ephedra  spp.). Several local endemics grow 
in this unique habitat  (USDI-FWS, 1994; Welsh et 
al., 2003) .

Adaptation 
Uinta Basin waxfruit is endemic to the Green River 
Formation, a highl y erodible calcareous shale stratum 
(USDI -FWS, 1994).  This species occurs from 1,645 
to 1,830 m (5,400 to 6,000 ft) in a 15 to 23 cm (6 to 9 
in) precipitation zone (WRCC, 2011).  
 
Management  
Existing threats to Uinta Basin waxfruit  include oil 
and gas explo ration, oil-shale mining, stone 
quarrying, and off -road vehicle (ORV) use.  All 
known populations are found on Federal lands leased 
for oil and gas energy reserves. Additionally, this 
species ’ range is underlain by oil shale, which may 
be mined when economic  conditions for oil 
extractions become  favorable (USID-FWS, 1994).  
 
Due to its extreme rarity and its long -term decline, 
downlisting or delisting of  Uinta Basin waxfruit is 
unlikely in the near future. Management goals 
include the establishment of a minimum of 5 separate 
popula tions consisting of 2,000 or more individuals 
per population. This is to be accomplished by  
controlling the habitat threatening activities listed 
above, and by identifying suitable habitat for 
additional populations  and introducing propagated 
materials  (USDI -FWS, 1994).  
 
Pests and Potential Problems  
Historical sheep and cattle grazing  use may have 
impacted  Uinta Basin waxfruit  on US DI-BLM lands. 
However current grazing levels are not believed to 
pose a serious threat  (USDI -FWS, 1994).  
  
 
 
E
 nvironmental Con
cerns 
There are no known environmental concerns 
associated with  Uinta Basin waxfruit . 
Seed and Plant Production  
F
 lowering occurs from April to May with fruit 
ripening in May to June.  Individual flowers bloom 
for 3 to 5 days. Uinta Basin waxfruit is capabl e of 
self -pollination, but significantly more seed is 
produced via cross -pollination. Numerous native, 
solitary, ground nesting bees have been identified 
foraging in Uinta Basin waxfruit including Dialictus  
perdifficilis, D. sedi, Evylaeus pulveris , and Andrena 
walley i (USDI -FWS, 1994).  There has been limited 
success with propagation attempts (CPC, 2011).
