Uses 
There are no known human uses of Deseret 
milkvetch.  This species appears to be  non toxic to 
cattle, and though not considered primary forage, it 
may be inadvertently grazed along with other food 
sources (USDI -FWS, 1999).  
Status 
Deseret milkvetch was  considered extinct for decades 
until its rediscovery in 1981. It is known from a 
single population in Utah County, Utah. Deseret 
milkvetch was listed in 1999 by the Fish and  Wildlife 
Service as threatened (USDI -FWS, 1999). In 2007, 
the Fish and Wildlife Service gave advanced notice 
of intention to remove Deseret milkvetch from  the 
list of endangered and threatened plants in the near 
future (USDI -FWS, 2007).  It was determined  that 
previous threats were not as significant as once 
believed, and that the species is not likely to become 
in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant 
portion of its range in the foreseeable future.  Surveys 
conducted in 2006 indicated that th e known 
population had increased by 31 percent since the time 
of listing (USDI -FWS, 2007).

Description  
General :  Legume  family ( Fabaceae).  Deseret 
milkvetch is a short -lived perennial forb rising from a 
subterranean caudex. The leaves are 4 to 12 cm (1.6 
to 4 .7 in) long with 11 to 17 leaflets, each being 2 to 
14 mm (0.08 to 0.6 in) long and 1.5 to 8 mm (0.06 to 
0.3 in)  wide. The leaves and stems are hairy. The 
inflorescence is a 5 to 10 flowered raceme. The 
flowers are whitish with pale purple wings and a 
purple -tipped keel. The fruit is a densely hairy, 
curved, oval pod, 10 to 20 mm (0.4 to 0.8 in) long 
and 5 to 10 mm ( 0.2 to 0.4 in) thick (Welsh et al., 
2003).  
Distribution :    
Deseret milkvetch is known from a single location in 
Utah County, Utah in the Thistle Creek watershed 
east of Birdseye, Utah. The total occupied area 
covers approximately 345 acres (USDI -FWS, 2007) . 
 
For current distribution, consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.  
 
Habitat :  
Desert milkvetch is restricted to steep, sandy, west 
and south facing slopes of the Moroni Formation at 
elevations from 1,645 to 1,700 m  (5,400 to 5,600 ft). 
The associated vegetation is an open pinyon -juniper 
community with sagebrush  (Artemisia tridentata ), 
bitterbrush  (Purshia tridentata) , Indian ricegrass 
( Achnatherum hymenoides ) and needle- and-thread  
( Stipa comata). 
 
Adaptation  
This species is  endemic to sandy -gravelly soils 
weathered from conglomerate outcrops of the Moroni 
Formation (USDI -FWS, 2007). The mean annual 
precipitation for th e population is 30 to 35 cm (12 to 
14 in) (Western Regional Climate Center, 2010).  
 
Management  
This species  was listed as threatened due to its 
restricted population size and several potential threats 
to its habitat. Those threats included rural 
development, cattle grazing and impacts to pollinator 
habitat. Since listing, the population has grown 
considerably and the threats do not appear as 
significant as earlier  believed. Approximately 67 
percent of the species’ range is managed by the Utah

Department of Wildlife Resources as part of the 
Northwest Manti Wildlife Management Area. 
UTDWR management provides protection against 
anticipated threats, thus mitigating concern for the 
species.

Seeds and Plant Production  
Deseret milkvetch flowers and sets seed in May and 
June.  Its primary pollinators are believed to be  
bumblebees or other pollen generalist bee species 
( CPC, 2010 ).
