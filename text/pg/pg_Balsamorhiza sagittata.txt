Uses  
Wildlife : A wide variety of wildlife  utilizes arrowleaf 
balsamroot. Deer, elk, bighorn sheep and pronghorn eat 
the leaves, stems and flowers.  Arrowleaf balsamroot can 
be used to improve spring and summer forage in open 
rangelands.  Ogle and Brazee (2009) list arrowleaf 
balsamroot as desired forage for cattle , sheep, elk, and 
pronghorn in spring and summer.   Young tissues of 
arrowleaf  balsamroot contain nearly 30% protein 
(Rickets , 1994).  Arrowleaf balsamroot is attractive to  native pollinators (
Cane, 2011;  Ogle and others , 2011b ). 
The seeds are eaten by birds and rodents. It is believed 
that the presence of arrowleaf balsamroot may serve as an 
i ndicator of good habitat for sage -grouse  (Klebenow , 
1969).   
 
Restoration : Because of its showy flowers and dominance 
on the landscape, arrowleaf balsamroot is commonl y used 
in restoration seedings. The species is believed to have 
potential for use in oil shale, roadside and mining 
restoration practices ( Wasser, 1982 ). A ttempts to seed 
arrowleaf balsamroot outside its natural area of 
occurr ence have been largely unsuccessful ( Stevens and 
Monsen,  2004) .  
 
Medicinal:  Arrowleaf balsamroot has been found to 
contain antibacterial compo unds (Matsuura and others, 
1996), and has been used as an herbal medicine 
(Chambers and others,  2006 ).

Description  
General : Sunflower family (Asteraceae). Arrowleaf 
balsamroot is a long -lived perennial forb native to western 
North America. The  sagittate (arrowhead shaped)   leaves 
are  mostly all basal and petiolate, 5 to 45 cm ( 2 to 18 in) 
long  and 1.5 to 15 cm ( 0.6 to 6 in) wi de.  Upper stem 
leaves are smaller and linear to elliptic. The leaves are 
silvery white to green. Several flower stems arise from the 
root crown to a height of 15 to 80 cm ( 6 to 31 in). The 
stems  bear a solitary floral head with  yellow ray and disk 
flowers.  Eight to twenty -five ray  flowers  with 20 to 60 
mm  (0.8 to 2.4 in) long petals surround a disk that is 12 to 
25 mm in diameter . Both the ray and disk flowers are 
fertile. The fruit is a glabrous achene with no pappus 
( Weber ,  1997;  Welsh and others , 2003 ).  The taproots can 
be quite large reaching 2.7 m (8.8 ft) long and 10 cm (4 
in) in diameter. Deep lateral roots can run horizontally for 
60 to 100 cm (2 to 3 ft)  (Weaver , 1915).  
Ethnobotany  
Many tribes used arrowleaf balsamroot medicinally. The 
Blackfoot use d root smoke to treat body aches (Hellson, 
1974).  The Blackfoot, Gosiute, Kutenai, Paiute, Sanpoil 
and Shoshoni  used a poultice  made from the roots  to treat 
blisters, sores, insect bites, bruises and wounds (Hellson , 
1974; Chamberlin, 1911; Hart, 1992; Train and others, 
1941; Ray, 1932). Root infusions were used by the 
Cheyenne and Flathead to treat fevers, whooping cough,
