Alternate Names

Uses  
Uinta Basin cactus and other rare cacti are targeted  
by cactus collectors . These species have no known 
human uses. The flowers are visited by numerous 
insects including bees, ants  and beetles (USDI -FWS, 
2007).  
Status 
Uinta Basin hookless cactus ( Sclerocactus glaucus ) 
was listed as a threatened species by the USDI Fish 
and Wildlife Service in 1979 (USDI -FWS, 1979). 
Since that time, the species has undergone numerous 
taxonomic changes, being described as up to  three 
distinct taxa. In 2009, the USDI -Fish and W ildlife 
Service followed Hochst ätter’s treatment of the genus 
(1997) and the taxonomic nomenclature accepted by 
the Flora of North America (Heil and Porter, 2004), 
and  relisted three species as threatened: Pariette 
cactus ( S. brevispinus ), Colorado hookless cactus ( S. 
glaucus ) and Uinta Basin hookless cactus ( S. 
wetlandicus ) (USDI-FWs, 2009) .  
 
USDI -FWS has further  stated their intent to propose 
reclassification  of Pariette cactus from threatened to 
endangered  (USDI -FWS, 2006).  
 
C onsult the PLANTS Web site  and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status ( e.g., threatened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
Description  
General : Cactus  family ( Cactaceae).  Plants of all 
three species grow as unbranched spheres or 
cylinders with tubercles on the ribs.  The above 
ground  portion of the spheres reaches 4 to 18 cm (2 
to 7 in) tall and 2.5 to 12 cm (1 to 4.5 in) in diameter. 
There are 6 to 14 radial spines and 1 to 5 central 
spines per areole. The flowers are funnel or bell -
shaped , 5 cm long ( 2 in ) and 2  to 3 cm ( 0.8 to 1.2  in) 
across. The inner tepals  are pink or violet, 2 to 3 cm 
(0.8  to 1.2 in)  long and 3 to 6 mm ( 0.1 to 0.2 in)  
wide. The fruit is an indehiscent oval shaped  berry. 
The seed  is black, 1.5 to 2.5 mm ( 0.06 to 0.1  in) long 
(Heil and Porter, 2004) . 
 
The three species can be tentatively  separated as 
follows  (Heil and Porter, 2004) :

1. Seed surface composed of convex cells; plants of 
Colorado              S. glaucus  
 
1. Seed surface composed of flattened cells; plants of 
Utah      
 
2. Abaxial  central spines usually not hooked; flowers  
fu nnel shaped; outer and inner tepals  brownish 
lavender, violet, or pink, 2.5 to 5 cm diameter  
               S. wetlandicus 
 
2. Abaxial central spines often absent, or if present, 
then all curved or hooked; flowers  bell shaped ; outer 
tepals greenish to purple, inner tepals purple, 1.1 to 3 
cm diameter          S. brevispinus  
 
Distribution :    
Colorado hookless cactus is known from populations 
in Montrose, Mesa, Delta a nd Garfield Counties, 
Colorado.  
 
Uintah Basin hookless cactus is endemic to the Ui nta 
Basin in northeastern Utah. Its range covers an area 
approximately  96 km long by 40 km wide ( 60 mi by 
25  mi)  wide containing approxi mately 30,000 
individuals.   
 
Pariette cactus is restricted to the Pariette Draw of the 
central Uinta Basin (USDI -FWS, 2006b ). There is a 
single known population covering an area of 
approximately 16 km (10 mi) long by 8 km (5 mi) 
wide. The total species pop ulation is estimated at 
8,000 individuals (USDI -FWS, 2007).  
 
For current distribution, consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.  
 
Habitat :  
These three cactus species grow on sparsely 
vegetated  arid desert shrubland  in association with 
shadscale ( Atriplex confertifolia ), rabbitbrush 
( Ericameria nauseosa) and horsebrush ( Tetradymia 
spp.).  
 
Adaptation   
Colorado hookless and Uinta Basin hookless cact us 
are found on coarse soils derived from stream terrace 
deposits, or on rocky surfaces on mesa slopes at 
1,350 to 1,900 m (4,400 to 6,200 ft) in elevation. 
Pariette cactus is  found on fine clay soils in the 
badlands derived from the Uinta Formation  (USDI -
FWS, 2006 b). The range of all three species lies in an 
area receiving 15 to 22 cm (6 to 9 in) of mean annual 
precipitation.  
 
Management  
Habitat of all three cactus species is threatened by oil 
and gas production and development. Most of the 
range of Uinta Basin cactus lies within existing oil 
and gas fields or within undevel oped oil and gas lease  areas (USDI
-FWS, 2006a ). Additional threats come 
from illegal collection from succulent plant 
enthusiasts.  Illegal collection rates continue to 
increase as oil and gas related roads are created in the 
species ’ range.  Livestock trampling and recreational 
off highway vehicle (OHV) use are also considered 
threats.  
 
 
 
P

ests and Potential Problems 
Parasitism is known to occur with other members of 
the genus; however, specific threats are as yet 
unknown for these three species . 
Environmental  Concerns 
There are no known environmental concerns  
associated with these three Sclerocactus  species.  
 
Seed and Plant Production  
These cactus species f lowers April to  May  and are  
pollinated  by native bees, and possibly ants and 
beetles (USDI -FWS, 2007).
