Uses  
There are no known human or wildlife uses for 
Winkler’s pincushion cactus.  Plants are eagerly 
sought by collectors for horticultural purposes 
leading to the species’  decline (USDI -FWS, 1979) . 
Status 
Wright fishhook  cactus was listed as an  endangered  
species  by the USDI F ish and Wildlife Service in 
1979  based on its limited popula tion size and 
distribution as well as known and potential threats 
from collection, mineral exploration, and off road 
vehicle (ORV) use (USDI -FWS, 1979 ). In 2005 the 
USDI -FWS  affirmed this listing, noting there is not 
substantial information warranting the delisting of    
Wright fishhook cactus (USDI
-FWS, 2005). Field 
surveys indicate the species is  slowly declining 
within its known range.

Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s

state noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
Description  
General : Cactus  family ( Cactaceae).  Wright fishhook 
cactus is a hemispheric or s hort-cylindrical cactus 
reaching 6 to 12 cm (2.4 to 4.8 in) tall and 4 to 8 cm 
( 1.6 to 3.1 in) in diameter. Each plant has 8 to 13 ribs 
with tubercles approximately 12 mm ( 0.51 in) long 
by 9 mm ( 0.35 in) across and 6 to 9 m m (0.24 to 0.35 
in) high. There a re 1 to 4 central spines , typically 10 
to 20 mm (0.39 to 0.79 in) long with the uppermost 
spines reaching 25 mm ( 0.98 in) long;  the lower 
central spine is  often hooked on at le ast the upper 
tubercles. Each tubercle has 8 to 11 white, spreading, 
radial spin es, 6 to 12 mm (0.24 to 0.47 in) long. The 
flowers are 2 to 3.5 cm ( 0.8 to 1.4 in) long with green 
to brownish tinged sepaloids and white, pink or 
yellow petaloids. The fruit is an elliptical 9 to 12 mm 
( 0.35 to 0.51 in) long berry with 3 mm ( 0.12 in) long, 
black  seeds (Welsh et al., 2003).  
 
Distribution : 
Wright fishhook cactus occurs in two general areas in 
central Wayne County, Utah and south western 
Emery County, Utah. Individual populations are 
small with few scattered plants . The most recent 
surveys estimate the total number of individuals at 
4,500 to 21,000 (USDI -FWS, 2005).  
 
For current distribution, consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.  
 
Habitat :  
Wright fishhook cactus grows in a range of arid 
habitats including clay flats in mat saltbush ( Atriplex 
corrugat a) communities, sandy sites with galletta 
grass ( Hilaria jamesii) and purple  three-awn 
( Aristida  purpurea), and pinyon- juniper woodlands 
( Pinus  edulis  and  Juniperus osteosperma) with a bl ue 
grama ( Bouteloua gracilis ) understory (USDI -FWS, 
1985).  
 
Adaptation  
Unlike many of the other sensitive species of the 
region, Wright fishhook cactus is not an edaphic 
specialist, and can be found in a wide variety of soil

types and plant communities fro m fine clay to sand 
(USDI -FWS, 1985; Welsh et al., 2003) . Plants are 
rare where cryptogamic crusts are damaged or 
undeveloped (USDI -FWS, 1985).  The majority of the 
known range of Wright fishhook cactus falls in a 15 
to 23 cm (6 to 9 in) mean annual precipitation zone 
(WRCC, 2011).  
 
Management  
Wright fishhook cactus is threatened by habitat 
degradation and plant damage resulting from cattle 
trampling, ORV use, hiking, mountain biking and 
other human recreational activities. This species is 
also targeted by cactus collectors, and illegal 
collection continues to significantly affect plant 
reproduction and recruitment (USDI -FWS, 2005).   
 
Pests and Potential Problems  
This species is susceptible  to infestations of cactus 
borer beetles ( Moneilema semipunctatum ) (USDI-
FWS, 2005). Kass (2001) observed 23 percent of all 
mortality during a seven year period resulted from 
cactus borer beetle damage.  Blister beetles (Epicauta 
sp .), Ord kangaroo rats (Dipodomys  ordii ), and 
white -tailed antelope ground squ irrels 
( Ammospermophilus  leucurus ) have also been 
identified as mortality sources (Kass, 2001).

nvironmental Concerns  
There are no known environmental concerns 
regarding Wright fishhook cactus.  
 
Seed and Plant Production  
Wright fishhook cacti re produce primarily via seed; 
however, budding has also been observed. Plants 
flower in spring with fruit maturing in June. Specific 
pollinators are unknown;  though  ants and beetles 
have been observed foraging in flowers and may 
contribute to pollen transfer . Maturing fruits dehisce 
along a circular horizontal line near or below the 
middle  of the fruit  allowing seed dispersal (USDI -
FWS, 1985).
