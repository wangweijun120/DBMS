browsing by deer and rabbits (High Country Gardens 
2010).  
 
Pollinators:  Purple sage provides nectar and pollen 
for bees, butter flies and moths.

revegetation and diversification of rangeland, 
particularly in harsh, rocky sites.  
Forage:   Purple sage is undesirable as forage to both 
livestock and wildlife.  
 
Ethnobotanical:   This plant w as used for multiple 
medicinal and cultural purposes by tribes throughout 
its range.  People of the Kawasiiu, Paiute, Shoshoni, 
Washoe and Okanagan -Colville tribes made infusions 
and decoctions of the leaves and stems of purple sage 
for a cold remedy.  The y also made poultices of the  leaves to apply to the chest, smoked dried leaves and 
made steam baths with the leaves to ease congestion.  
Infusions, decoctions, washes and poultices of this 
plant were also used to treat headaches, 
stomachaches, fever, influ
enza, pneumonia, 
gonorrhea, swollen leg veins, eye problems and 
general illness (Native American Ethnobotany 
Database 2010).  The Hopi used smoke and an 
infusion of the plant to alleviate epilepsy and 
faintness and the Kawaiisu threw the plant into fire to  
keep away spirits and ghosts (Native American 
Ethnobotany Database 2010).   The Hopi, Kumiai,
