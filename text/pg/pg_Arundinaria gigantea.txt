Uses  
Cultural : D ense stands of cane , known as 
canebrakes,  have been likened to a “supermarket” 
offering material for many purposes ( Figure  2) 
(Kniffen et al. 1987).  Cane provided the Cherokee 
with material for fuel and candles and the coarse, 
hollow  stems were made into hair ornaments, game 
sticks, musical instruments, toys, weapons, and tools 
(Hill 1997; Hamel and Chiltoskey 1975). The 
Houma, Koasati, Cherokee, Chitimacha, Chickasaw, 
Choctaw, and Seminole made the stems into arrow 
shafts, blowguns ( Figure 3)  and darts (Figure  4)  for  hunting squirrels, rabbits, and various birds 
(Bushnell 1909; Hamel and Chiltoskey 1975; Speck 
1941; Kniffen et al. 1987). Young Cherokee boys 
used giant cane blowguns armed with darts to 
protect ripening cornfields from scavenging birds 
and small mammals (Fogelson 2004). The Choctaw 
used the butt end of a cane, where the outside skin 
was thick, as a knife to cut meat, or as a weapon 
(Swanton 1931). Tribes of Louisiana made flutes, 
duck calls, and whistles out of cane (Kni
ffen et al. 
1987).  Cane is best harvested in the fall or winter 
(October to February) for blow guns and flutes, and 
plant stems, known as  culms ,  are selected from 
mature, hardened off plants with larger diameters.

Plants at least one foot high, and with two feet long 
rhizomes and roots attached, can be dug and 
transplanted  into a well -drained, fertile soil, three to 
six inches deep. However, water must be available 
for these transplants. If regular irrigation is not 
available, transplanting must be done in the  winter 
months (December through the first weeks of 
March).The soil should have a pH level of 6.8 to 7.2 
and sandy soils and areas that have peat tend to 
produce larger varieties of cane (Oakes 2006).   
 
Giant cane should have at least three to four hours 
of  direct sunlight daily. Full sun exposure seems to 
limit top growth, but strongly enhances rhizome and 
root growth, allowing maximum overall growth of 
the canebrake (Neal et al. 2011; Russell et al. 2011). 
If planting giant cane on the grounds surrounding 
the home, keep the plants moist during the first year, 
but not waterlogged . After one year of 
establishment, apply fertilizer that contains nitrogen, 
phosphorous and potassium (NPK), and every other 
year, any type of composted manure (chicken, 
horse, and cow) can be substituted (Oakes 2006). 
Manure can be applied in late fall or early winter 
(Oakes 2006).  
 
Currently researchers are investigating methods of 
vegetative propagation in order to increase the 
supply of plant materials for restoration projects. 
M .C. Mills (2011) found that planting giant cane 
amongst established, clump -forming grasses such as 
big bluestem ( Andropogon gerardii ) and Indiangrass 
( Sorgastrum nutans ), may provide some 
environmental facilitation, while reducing direct 
competition becaus e of the differing growth 
strategies.   Paul R. Gagnon (2009) implores 
managers to consider fire- maintained plant 
assemblages within bottomland hardwood forests as 
part of restoration plans.   Dr. Brian Baldwin (2009) 
at Mississippi State University has, in collaboration 
with EPA Region 4, NRCS -AWCC and the 
Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians (MBCI), 
developed propagation techniques and re -
established cane in the Pearl River watershed on 
land belonging to the Mississippi Choctaw (Jolley et 
al. 2009).   
 
Not on ly the MBCI but also other tribes have put 
much effort into restoring cane stands so that they 
can continue their traditions (Oakes 2006). Cane has 
been re- established on the Chitimacha Reservation 
in Louisiana and at Kituwha, North Carolina with 
the Easte rn Band of Cherokee (NRCS 2002; 2004). 
Due to limited access to favorable habitat on tribal 
lands, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians is 
working closely with local conservation groups and 
land managers to preserve and expand existing cane, 
establish new canebrakes, and secure access for 
Cherokee artists (D. Cozzo, pers. comm. 2011).  Basketry traditions are being passed down to the 
youth, as part of cultural revitalization (
Figure 9 ).

Management 
Harvesting giant cane judiciously can be good for 
the plant as Sarah H. Hill (1997) explains among the 
Southeastern Cherokee: “Cutting cane also 
stimula ted its regeneration by creating openings for 
the spread of new stems. Selective cutting of stalks 
for baskets is an effective way to prune stands.”   
Native Americans burned cane once every seven  to 
10 years   (Campbell  1985; Hill 1997; Platt and 
Brantley 1997). Writing about the prairies in south 
central Arkansas, geologist Featherstonhaugh (1844) 
recorded the burning of the cane and high grass by 
the Indians to secure their game. Ecologists have 
concluded that fire will  maintain and even expand 
canebrakes if occurring once every 10 years 
(DeVivo 1991; Shepherd et al. 1951, Hughes 1957). 
Fires set in fall, winter, or spring may improve 
conditions for cane and with fire exclusion, cane 
colonies lose vigor and are gradually  replaced by 
woody vegetation (Hughes 1957; Platt and Brantley 
1997). Paul R. Gagnon and William J. Platt (2008a) 
hypothesize that multiple disturbances that include 
fire and windstorms or other space -opening 
disturbances promote monotypic -stand formation in

giant cane and fire spurs clonal growth in giant 
cane’s mature phase. 
 
As early as 1913, anthropologist Frank G. Speck 
recorded among the Cherokee weavers in the Great 
Smoky Mountains of western North Carolina that 
the giant cane was getting scarcer (Sp eck 1920). In 
1979, Libby Jo Devine (1979) completed a Master’s 
Thesis at Georgia State University and she recorded 
that “a [southeastern] basketmaker will have to 
travel 60 -100 miles for river cane, as it is becoming 
scarce.” Many of the floodplain forest s connected 
with the river systems with canebrakes were 
converted to agricultural lands. Canebrakes also 
diminished with changes in hydrological regimes 
with dams and the creation of recreational 
impoundments, and overgrazing by domestic 
livestock (Brantle y and Platt 2001; Thomas et al. 
1996). Many patches of cane have stopped 
producing due to overcrowding of hardwoods and 
pines and thinning the trees 50 to 75 percent will 
allow cane to have less competition for growth and 
increase productivity (Oakes 2006) .  
 
Fires, from lightning and Native Americans 
rejuvenated canebrakes, but after European 
settlement these fire regimes were altered, 
sometimes converting giant cane to grasslands or 
open savanna (Brantley and Platt 2001; Wells and 
Whitford 1976 cited in P latt and Brantley 1997). In 
the absence of enriching fire and flood, canebrakes 
reach maturity in about ten years. Stalks then begin 
to decline in vigor and gradually die. In contrast to 
the rapid re -growth that follows disturbance, 
undisturbed regeneratio n may take as long as several 
decades (Hughes 1966).   
Steven Platt and Christopher Brantley (1997) 
suggest that the best strategy for cane restoration is 
to manage and expand existing cane stands through 
a combination of thinning the overstory, periodic 
bu rning, and possibly fertilization. Hughes (1957) 
also recommended controlled burning as a means to 
renovating decadent cane stands.  
Control  
Please contact your local agricultural extension 
specialist or county weed specialist to learn what 
works best in y our area and how to use it safely.  
Always read label and safety instructions for each 
control method.  Trade names and control measures 
appear in this document only to provide specific 
information.  USDA NRCS does not guarantee or 
warranty the products an d control methods named, 
and other products may be equally effective.  
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and 
area of origin)  
This plant is available from native plant nurseries. 
Also check with your local NRCS Plant Materials 
Center for possible sources of existing plant  materials. Research conducted on canebrakes that 
are flowering but not producing seed indicates that 
many canebrakes in some areas are composed of 
only one individual, or two related individuals. 
Giant cane is like people when it comes to 
producing offspring. In order for restoration projects 
using vegetative material or seed to be successful in 
the long term, restoration plants should use a 
mixture of genotypes (cane plants/propagules from 
several locations or watersheds) (Baldwin
 2010).
