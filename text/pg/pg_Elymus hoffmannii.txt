Uses   
Grazing/range/pasture : RS hybrid wheatgrass is an 
advanced -generation hybrid between quackgrass ( Elymus 
repens ) and bluebunch wheatgrass ( Pseudoroegneria 
spicata ) (Jensen et al. 2001).  It has fair to good forage 
quality for cattle, sheep and horses (Snyder, 1992).    
  Hay:
 RS  hybrid wheatgrass can provide more than one 
crop of hay each year with proper management.  Under 
high soil fertility and adequate irrigation, forage yields are 
lower than other forage grasses such as orchardgrass, 
meadow brome and tall fescue (Jensen et al . 2001).   
 
Wildlife : RS hybrid wheatgrass provides fair to good 
cover for small mammals, nongame birds, upland game 
birds and waterfowl (Snyder, 1992).    
 
Erosion control/reclamation: RS hybrid wheatgrass is 
especially suited for erosion control and reclamation on 
slight to moderate saline soils.

Description   
General: Grass Family (Poaceae).  The botanical 
description of Elymus hoffmannii  is from a breeding line 
of plants developed from seeds collected in Erzurum 
Province, Tur key by J.A. Hoffman and R.J. Metzger in 
1979 (Jensen and Asay, 1996).  There is no information 
regarding its native distribution.   
 
RS hybrid wheatgrass is slightly to  moderately 
rhizomatous with glabrous culms reaching, 54 -135 cm 
(21 -53 in).  Leaves are evenly distributed along the culm; 
sheaths are glabrous and auricles absent to 1 mm (0.003 
in), truncate and erose.  Leaf blades are 5 -13 mm (0.02-
0.05 in) wide, flat to involute, the top surface smooth and 
glabrous, the bottom surface smooth with the veins 
closely spaced, more or less equally prominent , smooth 
or scabrous.  The spikes are 10 -50 cm (4- 20 in) long, 0.8 -
1.8 cm (0.3- 0.7 in) wide with 1 spikelet per node.  
Spikelets are 15 -27 mm (0.06- 0.11 in) long with 5 -7 
florets.  Glumes are equal, 5 -11 mm (0.02- 0.04 in) long, 
1.3 -1.8 mm (0.05- 0.07 in) wide and disarticulation is 
above the glumes.  Elymus hoffmannii  differs from 
Elymus repens  (quackgrass) primarily by hav ing longer 
leaves, shorter awns on the glumes, and less rhizome 
development.  Elymus hoffmannii  is predominantly cross -
pollinated and chromosome number is 2n = 42, x = 7.  
The description for Elymus hoffmannii  was written to 
encompass the released cultivar  ‘Newhy’ and some 
taxonomists believe the cultivar should be identified as x 
Pseudelymus  ‘Newhy’ because it is derived from an 
artificial cross between Elymus repens  and 
Pseudoroegneria spicata  (Barkworth, Campbell and 
Salomon, 2007).
