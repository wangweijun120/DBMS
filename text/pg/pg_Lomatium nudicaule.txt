Uses  
Barestem biscuitroot is p alatable primarily to sheep but 
grows in such limited quantities that it is hardly  an 
important forage species (Hermann 1966).  It serves as a 
h ost plant for the larvae of anise swallowtail butterfly 
( Papilio zelicaon ) (Pelini et al 2009).  
Status  
Please con sult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plantâ€™s current 
status ( e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
Description  
General :  Carrot family (Apiaceae).  Barestem  biscuitroot 
is a perennial forb arising from a stout taproot. The plants 
reach a mature height of 20 to 45 cm ( 8 to 18 in). The leaves are compound ternate to bi
-ternate (dividing into 
groups of three leaflets) . The leaflets are larger than the 
finely dissected leaflets common to  other biscuitr oots and 
very distinctive for the genus. Each leaflet is 2 to 5 cm 
( 0.8 to 2 in) long and ovoid to orbicular in outline with 
coarse teeth near the tip. The inflorescence is an umbel 
with 7 to 27, 8 to 10 cm  (3 to 4 in)  long rays. The petals 
are yellow. The  fruit is 8 to 12 mm ( 0.3 to 0.5 in) long; 2 
to 5 mm ( 0.08 to 0.2  in) wide with 0.5 mm ( 0.02 in) wide 
wings (Welsh et al 2003).  
 
Ethnobotany  
Barestem biscuitroot  was used by numerous Native 
American tribes. It was used as a cold remedy or cough 
medicine by the Cowichan, Kwakiutl, Nitinaht, Saanich 
and Thompson tribes (Turner and Bell 1971; Boas 1966; 
Turner et al 1983; Turner et al 1990). It was eaten raw 
and used  like celery by the Okanagon, Atsugewi and 
Paiute tribes (Garth 1953; Perry 1952; Mahar 1953). It 
was also boiled in water and drank as a tea by the 
Thompson tribe (Steedman 1928).  
Distribution :  Barestem biscuitroot is found in western 
North America in Br itish Columbia, Idaho, Utah, 
Washington, Oregon, Nevada and California.  For current 
distribution, please consult the  Plant Profile page for this 
species on the PLANTS Web site.  
Habitat :  Barestem biscuitroot is found in dry, open to 
sparsely wooded places in lowlands to middle elevations 
(Cronquist et al 1997). It is often found growing in 
sagebrush, pinyon- juniper, ponderosa pine, and mountain 
brush communities in the Intermountain West (Welsh et 
al 2003 ). 
Adaptation  
Barestem biscuitroot grows in s andy soils (Walker and 
Shaw  2005)  in areas receiving 350 mm (14 in) or more 
mean annual precipitation . 
Establishment  
Biscuitroot species can be b roadcast or drill seeded 
( Walker and Shaw 2005).  Best results can be obtained 
from dormant fall seedings into a firm, weed -free seed 
bed. Seed should be placed at a depth of 0.6 to 1.2 cm 
(0.25 to 0.5 in) and packed to ensure good seed to soil 
contact.   
Management  
Arrowleaf balsamroot should be used as a minor 
component of seed mixtures.  Management strategies 
should be based on the key species in the established plant 
community.  Grazing should be deferred on seeded lands 
for at least two growing seasons to allow for full stand
