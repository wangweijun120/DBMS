Uses  
Wildlife : Tapertip hawksbeard leaves are consumed by 
pre -laying sage  grouse hens and make up a large portion 
of their diet (Barnett and Crawford, 1994). Sage grouse 
chicks also feed on tapertip hawksbeard leaves in addition 
to the insects attracted by the flowers (Drut and others, 
1994; Klebenow and Gray, 1968).   
 
Although pollinators are not required for tapertip 
hawksbeard to set seed, h awksbeard species attract both 
generalist bees as well as those that specialize on the 
composite family. Bee genera observed foraging on  tapertip hawksbeard include Agaposte
mon, Andrena, 
Bombus, Colletes, Dialictus , Eucera, Evylaeus, Halictus, 
Lasioglossum, Megac hile, Osmia  and  Psithyrus  (Cane, 
2012).  
 
Tapertip hawksbeard provides f air to very good forage for 
sheep and cattle (Hermann, 1966). Ogle and Brazee 
(200 9) rate taper tip hawksbeard as preferred spring and 
summer forage for sheep and desirable spring and 
summer forage for cattle, horses, elk, deer and antelope.  
The leaves contain approximately 30% crude protein, 
0.78% calcium and 0.5% phosphorus (Barnett and 
Crawford, 1 994). 
 
Ethnobotany: The Karok Indian Tribe in California  pealed 
and ate raw stems of tapertip hawksbeard (Moerman , 
1998 ).

Description  
General :  Sunflower family (Asteraceae). Tapertip 
hawksbeard is a native perennial forb  with one to several 
stems arising from a persistent woody base. Mature plants 
average 25 to 85 cm ( 10 to 33 in) tall. The basal and 
lower stem leaves are 10 to 40 cm ( 4 to 16 in) long with 
an elliptic to oblanceolate , pinnatifid to runcinate -
pinnatifid (d andelion shaped) blade. The plants bear 
numerous  cylindrical flower  heads, each with 5 to 10 
flowers.  The flowers bear a 10 to 18 mm ( 0.4 to 0.7 in) 
long yellow corolla. Tapertip hawksbeard is in the 
cichorieae tribe of the sunflower or composite family. 
M embers of this tribe all contain  milky juice and bear 
only ray -like flowers with no central disk  in the flower 
head . Tapertip hawksbeard is primarily apom ictic , 
producing seed asexually  (Babcock and Stebbins, 1938).   
 
The fruit is a yellow -tan to dark brow n achene, 7 to 9 mm 
(0.28 to 0.35 in) long and 1 to 2 mm (0.04 to 0.08 in) 
wide. Seed counts in the literature vary widely. Barner 
(2007) reported 363,000 seeds/kg (165,000 seeds/lb), 
while the PLANTS database reported 1,760,000 seeds/kg 
(800,000 seeds/lb)  (USDA- NRCS, 2011). Seed counts on 
more than 20 accessions conducted by the authors ranged 
from  220,000 to 575,000 seeds/kg (100,000 to 2 61,000 
seeds/lb).
