Uses  
Ethnobotany  
Canadian horseweed was used by numerous Native 
American peoples to treat a variety of ailments. It  was 
used by the Seminole as a cough and cold medicine 
(Sturtevant, 1954). The Navajo and Chippewa used 
Canadian horseweed for stomach pain (Densm ore, 1928; Wyman and Harris, 1951), and the Iroquois used an 
infusion of the plant to combat fevers (Rousseau, 1945)
. 
Status  
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status ( e.g., threatened  or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
Weediness  
This plant may become weedy or invasive in some 
regions or habitats and may displace desirable vegetation 
if not properly managed.  Please consult with your local 
NRCS Field Office, Cooperative Extension Service 
office, state natural resource, or state agr iculture 
department regarding its status and use.  Weed 
information is also available from the PLANTS Web site 
at 
http://plants.usda.gov/.  Please consult the Related Web 
Sites on the Plant Profile  for this species for further 
information.  
Description  
General :  Canadian horseweed is a native  winter or 
summer annual forb in the sunflower family. The plants 
are  erect with one to several stems reaching 30 to 150 cm 
(1 to 5 ft) tall. Stems are typically  unbranched at the base 
unless damage  has occurred to the apical growing points. 
The leaves are linear to oblanceolate, 2 to 8 cm ( 0.8 to 3.1 
in) long and 2 to 8 mm ( 0.08 to 0.31 in) wide. The leaf 
margins are ciliate -serrate.  The inflorescence is a loose 
panicle.  The numerous flower heads are very small,  2 to 4 
mm (0.08 to 0.16 in) tall and 3 to 7 mm ( 0.12 to 0.28 in) 
wide.  The rays are  white or purplish (Welsh et al., 2003) 
and very small, only reaching 0.5 to 1.0 mm (0.02 to 0.04 
in) in length (Cronquist  1994).  The fruit is an achene  with 
a white bristly pappus. There are approximately 700,000  
seeds per pound ( USDA-NRCS, 2012 ). 
Distribution :    
Canadian horseweed is native throughout much of North 
America. It was introduced into Europe in the  mid 17
th 
cent ury, likely along with  Canadian furs shipped to 
France.  For current distribution, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.  
 
Habitat : Canadian horseweed is common in grasslands 
and in  moist disturbed sites including riparian and 
wetland areas. It has become a common pest in 
agricultural locations throughout its range.  
Adaptation  
Canadian horseweed is adapted to a broad range of 
conditions and soil types. It prefers slightly acidic to 
neutral soils (pH 4.8 to 7.2) in a reas receiving 410 to

1,400 mm (16 to 55 in) annual precipitation (USDA -
NRCS, 2012) . The plants produce large quantities of 
windborne seed, making it an effective colonizer of 
disturbed soils  (Regehr and Bazzaz, 1979) . 
Establishment  
Canadian horseweed has been  described as both a summer 
annual and a winter annual  with seed germinating at any 
time with sufficient moisture and warmth (Waggoner et 
al., 2011) . In winter annual forms the seed germinates in 
the fall and the plant overwinters as a rosette. It then  bolts 
in the spring and produces flowers in mid to late summer. 
Spring germinating Canadian horseweed spends relatively 
little time as a rosette before bolting (Loux et al., 2006).  
 
The seed (achenes) are small and light and can trav el 
great distances in the wind . Dauer et al. (2007) reported 
seed of Canadian horseweed travelling at least 500 m 
( 1,640  ft) from source populations.  
 
Management  
Canadian horseweed increases under reduced tillage and 
no -till situations ( Steckel and Culpepper, 2006 ). Seed 
production and dissemination  in disturbed areas can be 
reduced  with mowing to reduce  spread.  Small occurrences 
can be controlled by pulling or roguing. For management 
of Canadian horseweed in agricultural situations, see 
“Control” below.  
 
Pests and Po tential Problems  
Horseweed species can serve as a host for the tarnished 
plant bug ( Lygus lineolaris ), which can be a pest in 
alfalfa, cotton and other agricultural crops (Loux et al., 
2006). Horseweeds can also be a host for the viral disease, 
aster yello ws, which is transported to other plants via 
leafhoppers (Loux et al., 2006).  
 
Vegetation of Canadian horseweed contains a terpene 
which can be irritating in the nostrils of horses (Whitson 
et al., 1996) . 
 
Canadian horseweed can reduce crop yields through 
direct competition for resources. Canadian horseweed is 
also known to contain allelopathic chemicals which can 
inhibit germination and reduce seedling growth in several 
species (Shaukat et al., 2003).  
Environmental Concerns  
Several herbicide resistant biot ypes of Canadian 
horseweed have been discovered. In 1980, a Gramoxone 
(Paraquat) resistant biotype was first reported. In 1989, 
atrazine resistant biotypes wer e discovered in Belgium. 
Horseweeds resistant to the  ALS ( acetolactate synthase) 
f amily of herbicides  were discovered in Israel  in 1993 
(Zheng et al., 2011) . A glyphosate resistant horseweed 
was first reported in 2000 (VanGessel, 2001). Since that 
time,  glyphosate resistant Canadian horseweed has  been 
found in much of the U.S ., Europe and Asia (Heap, 2012). 
  Control
 
Canadian horseweed is easier to control when plants are 
young  (less than 2 inches tall). Control efforts should be 
concentrated  in late  fall and early spring  when plants are 
young.   
 
The m ost effective treatment  for controlling Canadian 
horseweed  is 2, 4-D ester  or a combination of 2, 4- D ester 
plus glyphos ate (Loux et al., 2012) .  Herbicide treatments  
with residual activity to control later emerging horseweed 
are  also  recommended.   
 
Plants not killed by chemical  burn down will re-grow and 
be less susceptible to later herbicide applications. These 
plants often sprout multiple stems resulting in increased 
seed production. In populations with a resistant biotype, 
chemical treatments should contain three or more 
herbi cides (Loux et al., 2006). T hree-way mixture of 
glyphosate, 2, 4 -D ester, plus chlorimuron or cloransulam  
are recommended .  
 
Please contact your local agricultural extension specialist 
or county weed specialist to learn what works best in your 
area and how  to use it safely.  Always read label and 
safety instructions for each control method.  Trade names 
and control measures appear in this document only to
