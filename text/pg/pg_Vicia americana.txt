Description  
American  vetch is a  native rhizomatous, single -stemmed , 
climbing perennial forb that measurers up to 16  inches 
tall.  The  8 to 16 leaflets are broadly elliptical to linear 
measuring  0.4 to 1.5 inches in length.  The lower stipules 
are deeply  lacerated , often appearing star -like (Isley 
1998) . The inflorescence is a raceme with up to 10 purple 
flowers  approximately  0 .5 to 1.5 inches long.   Flowering 
occurs from May to August with the seeds maturing 
around  one month after pollination ( Voss, 1985; Wasser, 
1982) . The  fruit is  a  1 to 1.5 inch long  pod bearing  two to 
several pea- like seeds. There are approximately 33,000 
seeds/lb  ( USDA -NRCS , 2015) .  American vetch has a 
moderate to deeply -branched taproot which reaches a 
m aximum depth of 40 inches.  The deep tap root allows 
for the plant to exhibit characteristics of severe drought 
tolerance.    
  PLANTS currently recognizes three subspecies of 
American vetch
: ssp.  americana, ssp. minor , and ssp. 
mexicana  (USDA- NRCS, 2015).  V. a. ssp. americana  
bears more flowers , (5 -9) per inflorescence, and is more 
sprawling with prehensile, often branched , tendrils .  V. a. 
minor  has 3 to 4 flowers per inflorescence, er ect stems 
and non -prehensile tendrils (Isley, 1998).    Subspecies 
mexicana  has calyx teeth all equal, differing from  V. a. 
ssp.  americana  which has the upper two calyx teeth much 
shorter than the lower three (Gunn, 1979).   
 
Distribution :  American vetch is widely distributed west 
of the Mississippi River , in the northeastern United States,  
Alaska,  and parts  of Canada  (Stubbendiek  and Conard, 
1989 ). Mexican American vetch ( V. a. ssp. mexicana ) is 
restricted to the Sierra Leon Mountains in Mexico and is 
geographically separated from V. a.  ssp. americana  
(Gunn, 1979). V. a. ssp . minor  is found primarily in the 
short grass prairie but extends into the Intermountain 
region.  V. a. ssp. americana  covers the range of the 
species (Isley, 1998).

Habitat:   
American vetch grows in  a wide variety of habitats. It is 
typically found in  moist areas, including  swampy woods, 
mixed forests, sheltered canyons, and  clearings , but can 
also be found in arid locations on hilltops or valley 
badlands (Cronquist et al , 1989).    
Adaptation  
American  vetch is drought tolerant and has the ability  to 
fix nitrogen into the soil  (Stubbendiek  and Conard, 1989) . 
American vetch occurs  frequently on slightly saline to 
moderately acidic soils of medium to coarse texture, but 
can also be found on clays . In west ern mountains , 
American  vetch is usually more abundant in deep porous
