Alternate Names  
Lead -plant,  leadplant amorpha, downy indigobush, 
prairie shoestrings, buffalo bellows,  Amorpha 
brachycarpa  
Uses  
Erosion control: Can be used for soil  erosion control 
due to its deep, branching, woody root system.  
 
Ethnobotanic:  The Omaha Indians powdered the 
dried leaves and put them into cuts and open woulds 
where the astringent properties of the plant promoted 
scab formation (Kind scher, 1992).  A moxa was also 
made from the twig ends of lead plant to treat 
rheumatism and neuralgia  (Kindscher, 1992) .  A tea 
was made from the leaves of leadplant by many 
tribes.  The Potawatomi Indians drank the tea to treat 
pinworms and other intesti nal worms (Kindscher, 
1992) .  Leaves were also steeped and the liquid used  to treat eczema 
(Kindscher, 1992) .  The Lakota tribe 
mixed crushed leadplant leaves with buffalo fat for 
smoking material  (Kindscher, 1992) .  The 
Assiniboins and Sioux tribes made a  moistened 
powder from the roots of leadplant and beeplant 
( Cleome  sp.)  and then rubbed that on their clothes to 
gain “the power to attract buffalo and to kill as many 
of them as he wants” (Kindscher, 1992).   The 
common name of “buffalo bellows” was given to 
leadplant by some tribes because the blooming period 
coincided with the time of the year that the buffalo 
were  in rut and bellowing.  
 
Landscaping  and restoration:  Can be used as an 
ornamental because it has very showy flowers and is 
drought  and shade to lerant.  Used in restoration 
projects because it is a native nitrogen fixing plant 
that is also good for soil erosion control.  
 
Wildlife and Livestock : Leadplant is a floral food 
resource for pollinating insects, with pollen and 
nectar feeding solitary bees being some of the most 
important (Slagle and Hendrix, 2009).  Leadplant is a 
palatable plant to cattle, sheep, and horses.  It is also 
palatable to elk, mule deer, and white- tailed deer 
(Rosario, 1988).

Description  
General :  Fabaceae  (Bean Family) .  Subshrub that 
can reach to 3.3 ft ( 1 m ) tall.   Plants that are mowed 
off or hayed have herbaceous stems.  Leaves  are 1.6-
4 in ( 4-10 cm ) long with 15- 47 leaflets with 
lanceolate to elliptic or obl ong with each leaflet being 
0.1 -0.5 in ( 8-14 mm ) long and 0.1 -0.2 in ( 3-6 mm)  
wide.  The stems and bottoms of leaves are densely 
woolly.  Florescence is  2.4 -4 in  ( 6 -10 cm ) long and 
the single petal (standard) is about  0.1 -0.2 in  ( 4 -5 
mm ) long and purple in  color.  Fruit is densely 
wooly, curved, and about 0.18 in ( 4.5 mm) long.  The 
seeds of leadplant are an orange- brown color, 
e lliptical with a small beak on one  end and about 
0.07- 0.1 in ( 2-2.5 mm)  long (Bare, 1979).   Leadplant 
begins growth around May 1 a nd flowers in late June 
to July, matures in August to September, and stays 
green until frost.   The name leadplant comes from the 
lead -colored appearance caused by the silvery gray 
hairs on the foliage and stems (Haddock, 2005).

Distribution:  Leadplant is distributed throughout the 
Great Plains.  It is common from Manitoba and 
Ontario  and south to Texas and New Mexico, and 
east to Wisconsin, Michigan, and Iowa.  It also 
occurs in eastern Colorado, Utah, and Montana 
(Great Plains Flora Association, 1986).  
For current distribution, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site.  
Habitat :  It can be found in prairies, hillsides, 
roadsides, and open woodlands (Haddock, 2005).  
Leadplant does very well in sandy to silt -textured 
soils and is tolerant to weakly acidic, moderately 
alkalin e, and to weakly saline soils.   Leadplant is 
found in areas with little bluestem, big bluestem, 
switchgrass, Indian  grass, prairie dropseed, and also 
in sand bluestem, and prairie sandreed prairies.  
Adaptation  
Leadplant is winter hardy and has good drought and 
shade tolerance (Wasser, 1982).  Leadplant is very 
palatable to livestock but decreases and is intolerant 
of  close, repeated grazing and defoliation  (Wasser, 
1982) .  Leadplant is gener ally considered to be 
favored by fire and is usually present in increased 
numbers in the spring following a fire ( Bock and 
Bock, 1984; Rosario, 1988).  The top portion of the 
plant is most likely harmed by fire, but the 
underground parts of the plant survi ve (Rosario, 
1988).    
Establishment  
Reduce competition by preparing a firm, weed -free 
seedbed and planting pods separately or in rows that 
alternate with grasses (Wasser, 1982) .  Seeds should 
be inoculated with nitrogen fixing bacteria before 
planting (Roc k, 1981).  Seed should be planted 1/4 
in . to 3/16 in. deep (Vories, 1981).  Planting can be in 
the spring (Wasser, 1982) or in the fall (Vories, 
1981).  For full stands of leadplan t a seeding rate of 
20 to 30 pure live seed (PLS ) per square foot is 
needed.  For seeding in grass or grass forb mixtures a 
seeding rate of 0.5 to 1 PLS per acre is recommended  
(Wasser, 1982)  
 
S eed will need to be stratified.  Methods for 
stratification of seed are to sow seeds in the fall and 
let them stratify over winter (Brinkman, 1974), soak 
in water for 10 minutes (Brinkman, 1974), or soak in 
180- 200˚F  (82- 93˚C ) water for 12 hours then moist 
chill seed at 41˚F  (5 ˚C ) for 30 days (Babb, 1959; 
Vories, 1981).   Seed germination is epigeal and 
occurs at about 14 days in the laboratory according to 
Wasser (1982) and Vories (1981).  In the field under 
favorable conditions germination is about 20 days 
(Wasser, 1982).  
 
Leadplant can also be propagated by greenwood 
cuttings (Vories, 1981) in the summer, hardwood  cuttings in the fall, or by suckers (Wasser, 1982).  
Transplanting success is generally poor in prairie 
restorations, probably because competition is not 
adequately reduced (Wasser, 1982).
 
 
Management  
Initially grazing should be withheld and weeds 
contro lled by mowing above seedlings during 
establishment period.  Graze or mow conservatively 
and periodically graze only after dormancy to sustain 
cover and high production improvement, leaving tall 
stubble (Wasser, 1982).   The presence of leadplant on 
native  rangeland is usually indicative of a well 
managed area (Kindscher, 1992).  
Pests and Potential Problems  
Common pests of leadplant are grasshoppers, 
leafhoppers, and small mammals.  Leaf spots, rusts, 
downy mildew, and Cytospora amorphae  have been 
found on l eadplant but they are not considered major 
diseases (Wasser, 1982).  
Environmental Concerns  
Generally leadplant is a very slow growing plant and 
does not compete well with native warm -season 
grasses (Rosario, 1988).  Therefore it has very little 
potential  to become a weed problem in it s native 
distribution area  and there are no known 
environmental concerns associated with leadplant.  
Seeds and Plant Production  
Slagle and Hendrix (2009) indicated that a diversity 
of bee species visiting leadplant is important for 
maintaining fruit set of leadplant.  Seed becomes 
mature in late summer from August to September 
(Brinkman, 1974; Swingle, 1939; Vories, 1981).  
Harvest seed by hand -stripping from terminal 
branches (Wasser, 1982).   Mowing and windrowing 
can be used on large patches (Wasser, 1982).  Clean 
seed by using mechanic al flail, then double clean in 
C lipper cleaner and seed blower (Wasser, 1982).  
Good seed crops are produced at least every two 
years, with some seed produced every year.  
Estimates of the num ber of seeds per pound of 
leadplant varies fro m 87,900- 105,754 (Swingle, 
1939 ) to 296,000 (Brinkman, 1974) .  Storage of 
leadplant seeds should be in dry sealed containers at 
41˚F  (5 ˚C ) (Brinkman, 1974; Swingle, 1939; Vories, 
1981).    
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and 
area of origin)  
T hese  plant materials are somewhat readily available 
from commercial sources.  No known cultivars, 
improved, or selected materials of leadplant are 
known at this time.
