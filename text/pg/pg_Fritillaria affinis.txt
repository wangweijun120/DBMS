Uses 
Ethnobotanic: The bulbs of chocolate lily were eaten 
by most Coast and Interior Salish peoples, either 
boiled or steamed in pits.  Chocolate lily, also called 
“rice root” by Indian people, has bulblets that look  like grains of rice.  The bu
lbs grow relatively close to 
the surface and are easily extracted.  Bulbs were dug 
in spring (before flowering) or in summer or fall 
(after flowering) using a digging stick, a wooden 
spade, or the fingers.  Chocolate lily bulbs were 
cooked immediately, or could be partially dried, then 
stored in a cool place for winter use.  They were 
cooked for about 30 minutes in a cedarwood box, by 
boiling for a short time then mashing to a paste, or 
occasionally, by baking in ashes.  Chocolate lily 
bulbs were used as an item of trade.  Even when 
cooked, they are slightly bitter, and some people used 
to soak them in water overnight to reduce the bitter 
flavor.  In Fritillaria  species, the major carbohydrate 
is reported to be starch (Yuanovsky and Kingsbury 
1938).

Description 
General : Lily Family (Liliaceae).  Chocolate lily 
( Fritillaria affinis ) is a tall herbaceous perennial 
growing from white bulblets consisting of a few 
fleshy scales and many rice-grain-like offsets; its 
bulbs are usually smaller than  Fritillaria 
camchatcensis .  The stems are 20-50 cm tall, sturdy 
and unbranched, bearing 1-3 whorls of 5-11 lance-
shaped leaves.  Chocolate lily has bowl-shaped, 
distinctly nodding flowers with six tepals which are 
brown-mottled with green or  yellow.  The capsules 
are broadly winged. 
 
Distribution 
Chocolate lily is found in open dry woods and 
meadows from southern coastal British Columbia 
eastward to the Okanagan in eastern Washington and 
south to California.  In California, chocolate lily 
occurs commonly in oak or pine scrub and grasslands 
below 1800 m in the Klamath Ranges, north Coast 
Ranges, Cascade, northern Sierra Nevada Foothills, 
San Francisco Bay area (Hickman 1993).  Chocolate 
lily grows on well-drained soils on open slopes.  For 
current distribution, please consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Establishment 
Fritillaria species have become quite uncommon in 
the wild.   Fritillaria affinis  requires well-drained soil

and moderate summer watering but is intolerant of 
frequent watering (such as a lawn might receive).  
This plant tolerates shade, but prefers sun.  It may be 
difficult to get established. 
 
Fritillaria  species are frequently found in areas with 
soil moisture persisting throughout most of the 
growing season.  Fritillaria  propagates readily from 
seed, and the rice-like bulblets can be used for 
propagation.  This species grows well in well-
drained, loam soils that are neutral to slightly acid. 
 
Live Plant (bulb) Cultivation 
Fritillaria  species have bulbs that do well in moist 
shade.  Bulbs may be planted in pots or in a 
greenhouse bed or bulb frame.  It is best to store 
Fritillaria  bulbs in slightly moist bark, peat, shredded 
wood, or some other material.  Buy the bulbs as early 
as possible before they begin to grow.  Bulbs tend to 
deteriorate or rot if kept too long. 
 
Plant bulbs in soil that is rich in nutrients and humus 
and also retains moisture.   Incorporate plenty of leafy 
mold or some other organic matter, such as well-
rotted manure or compost, before planting.  Acid-
loving woodland bulbs thrive in the peat garden 
where at least half the soil is leaf mold, peat, or 
compost. 
 
Bulbs in containers should not be allowed to dry out 
when in growth and should be fed regularly with a 
high-potassium fertilizer to boost flower production.  
Wait until seeds have set and foliage begins to 
senesce before lifting bulbs out of soil, clean them, 
and store them in a cool, mo ist place.  Watch bulbs to 
prevent them from rotting or being affected by a 
fungal disease.   
 
Bulbs can increase naturally by forming bulblets 
around the bulb (the “rice” in “Indian rice”). 
Propagate the bulbs by separating these bulblets from 
the mother bulb and planting.  Bulbs should be 
separated every year or two. 
 
Seed Cultivation 
This species grows readily from seed.  Most bulbs 
take 3-5 years to reach mature flowering stage.  
Fritillaria  species do not flower regularly even in 
nature, and so are described as shy-flowering.  When 
seed capsules form, they begin to split when they are 
ripe.  Collect immediately, as seeds may be shed 
quickly.  Let the seeds dry without heat, and store 
them until sown in labeled paper packets in a cool, 
dry, airy place.  Do not use plastic bags, as the seeds 
are likely to rot. 
 
The best times to sow seeds are fall, but if seed is 
available earlier, sow immediately.  Germination 
should follow in early spring. 
 
The recommended potting soil for seed germination 
and emergence is a commercial sand-based mix; with 
one-quarter part coarse sand added if the mixture 
does not have a sandy appearance.  Space large, flat 
seeds of  Fritillaria  one seed’s width apart.  Sieve a 
light covering of the soil mix over the seeds so that 
they are no longer visible, and then cover with a 
generous layer of grit or aquarium gravel.  Label the 
pots with the plant name, seed source, and date.  
Stand the pots in a shady place in the open garden, or 
plunge them in a sand frame, and keep them moist. 
 
When the seedlings have germinated, bring the pots 
into full light in a cold frame or greenhouse.  Keep 
them moist until they show definite signs of dying 
down, and then water them very sparingly.  
Fritillaria  seedlings should be kept slightly moist 
during this senescent period.  Start watering again in 
early fall, or as soon as there is new growth, and keep 
the pots watered until the growth dies down.  Leave 
most bulbs for two growing seasons before repotting, 
unless they grow vigorously.  Larger bulbs are 
formed if these seedlings are fed the second year.  
Use a commercial liquid feed as used for tomatoes, 
but at half the manufacturer’s recommended strength.  
After two years, remove the bulbs from the pots after 
they have died back.  Separate out the bulblets, clean 
them gently, and repot them in clean, moist soil.  For 
Fritillaria  species, use a soil mix of one part 
sterilized leaf mold, one part peat or compost, and 
one part sterilized soil, with a further 1.5 parts of 
coarse horticultural sand or  seed-grown perlite.  It is 
better to grow seedlings in pots for 3-4 years before 
planting them outside. 
 
Management 
Traditional resource management  of chocolate lily 
includes the following (Turner and Deur 1999):  
•   Ownership of individual patches and their output 
by chiefs, ensuring long-term care and 
enhancement of plant production. 
•  Root feasts as a means of redistributing plant 
wealth and meeting ceremonial obligations. 
•  Specialized digging sticks as a harvesting tool to 
cultivate and turn over the soil. 
•  Harvesting at a set time of year, before or after 
plants have set seed . 
•  Regular use of same sites over time/generations. 
•  Care and assiduity in harvest. 
•  Turning of the soil or sod. 
•  Extending periods of harvest time.

•  Replanting and leaving behind portions of 
bulblets, to re-grow the following year. 
•  Weeding root patches. 
•  Individual patches and landscapes were burned 
regularly.
