CERRO HAWTHORN
Crataegus erythropoda Ashe 
Plant Symbol = CRER 
 
Contributed By: USDA NRCS National Plant Data 
Center 
 
Uses 
Erosion Control: Because cerro hawthorn tolerates a 
wide variety of sites, it can be planted to stabilize 
banks, for shelterbelts, and from wind and water 
erosion. 
 
Timber : Although the wood is hard and strong, it has 
no commercial value exce pt for tool handles and 
other small items. 
 
Wildlife : It provides excellent cover and nesting sites 
for many smaller birds.  Birds, rodents, and other 
smaller mammals eat the small fruits. 
 
Beautification : Excellent for environmental plantings 
including small specimen  tree and shrub border. 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status, such as, state noxious status and 
wetland indicator values. 
 
Description 
General: Rose Family (Rosaceae).  It is a native 
shrub or small tree that gr ows to sixteen feet high, 
with dense spreading, glabrous branchlets and 
sharply thorny.  Leaves are broadest near the base or 
middle, dark green, smooth at maturity, and 
sometimes shallowly lobed.   Flowers are white and 
produced in clusters of five to ten flowers.  Fruits are 
elongated, red to blackish in color.

Distribution : Cerro hawthorn grows from 
Washington to Wyoming, and south to Arizona and 
New Mexico. 
 
Adaptation 
Although it will succeed in pa rtial shade and different 
soil types, it grows best in full sunlight and well-
drained loamy soils.  Cerro hawthorn will tolerate 
wet soils before becoming drought tolerant once 
established.  It is wind tolerant, making it a good tree 
species in shelterbelt planting.  It is also tolerant of 
atmospheric pollution and performs well in urban 
settings. 
 
Establishment  
Propagation from Seed or Grafting:  Cerro hawthorn 
can be propagated by either seeds or grafting.  
Successful propagation using seeds requires acid 
scarification followed by warm stratification and 
prechilling.  Seeds, whose numbers per lb. varies 
with species, are planted early in the fall, in drill rows 
eight to twelve inches apart and covered with 1/4 
inch of soil.  Seedlings must not be kept in the 
nursery longer than a year.  
 
Containerized trees should be planted when they are 
no more than eight feet tall, in the fall or spring.  
Balled and burlapped trees should be planted in early 
spring. 
 
Grafting on seedling stock of  Crataegus oxyacantha 
or  Crataegus monogyna  is best carried out in the 
winter to early spring.

Management 
Pruning should be done in the winter or early spring 
in order to maintain a clear shoot leader on young 
trees and/or remove the weakest branches to allow 
more light to pass through.  Suckers or stems arising 
from the roots should be removed when they become 
noticeable. 
 
Pest and Potential Problems 
Although insects and diseases seldom affect cerro 
hawthorn, it is susceptible to fireblight, cedar-
hawthorn rust, cedar-quince rust, leaf blight, fruit rot, 
and leaf spot. 
 
Cultivars, Improved and Selected Materials (and 
area of origin) 
Consult you local nurseries to choose the right 
cultivar for your specific landscape.  Contact your 
local Natural Resources Conservation Service 
(formerly Soil Conservation Service) office for more 
information.  Look in the phone book under ”United 
States Government.”  The Natural Resources 
Conservation Service will be listed under the 
subheading “Department of Agriculture.”
