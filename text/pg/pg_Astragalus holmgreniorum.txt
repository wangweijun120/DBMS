Alternate Names  
Paradox milkvetch  
 
Uses  
There are no known human uses of the species.  The 
flowers are visited by numerous native solitary 
nesting bees (Tepedino, 2005).  
Status 
Holmgren  milkvetch  was listed as endangered in 
2001 due to its rarity and declining populations 
(USDI -FWS, 2001) . In  2006,  approximately 6,289 
acres were designated by the US DI Fish and Wildlife 
Service as critical habitat (USDI -FWS, 2006b ).

state noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
Description  
General : Legume  family ( Fabaceae).  Holmgren  
milkvetch is a short -lived per ennial forb.  It grows to 
a height of 4 to 12 cm (1.6 to 4.7 in) arising from a    
thickened taproot and root crown. It has pinnately 
compound leaves 4 to 22 cm (
1.6 to 8.7 in) long with 
5 to 23 broadly oval leaflets, 6 to 16 mm (0.2 4 to 
0.6 3 in) long and 3. 5 to 12 mm (0.14 to  0.47 in) wide. 
The inflorescence is a 4 to 16 flowered raceme. The 
pink -purple flowers are 18 to 24 mm ( 0.71 to 0.94 in) 
long, and produce claw -shaped elliptic pods, 2.5 to 
5.5 cm (0.9 to 2.2 in) long and 6 to 9 mm ( 0.2 to 0.4 
in) thick . In cross -section, the pods have a triangular 
outline. Each pod contains 30 to 34 seeds (Welsh et 
al., 2003).  
 
Distribution : 
There are s ix known populations  of Holmgren 
milkvetch,  all located within 16 km (10 mi) of St. 
George, Utah. Three are in Washington County, Utah 
and two straddle the border of Washington County, 
Utah and Mojave County, Arizona. Approximately 
one  half of the Holmgren milkvetch habitat is 
managed by the State o f Utah. 
 
For current distribution, consult the Plant Profile 
page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.  
 
Habitat :  
Holmgren milkvetch occurs in the Mojave Desert 
ecoregion in creosotebush  (Larrea tridentata ), white 
bursage  (Ambrosia dumosa)  and mixed desert scrub 
plant communities . Its native habitat is sparsely 
vegetated with less than 20  percent  living cover (Van 
Buren and Harper , 2003). Other native plant species  
in association with Holmgren milkvetch include 
desert goldenhead ( Acamptopappus 
s phaerocephalus ), Nevada jointfir ( Ephedra 
nevadensis ), Torrey’s jointfir (E . torreyana), 
threadleaf snakeweed ( Gutierrezia microcephala) , 
and big galleta ( Hilaria rigida) (Van Buren and 
Harper, 2003).  
 
Adaptation  
Holmgren milkvetch is endemic to the badlands of 
the Santa Clara and Virgin River drainages from 756 
to 914 m (2,480 to 3,000 ft) in elevation. The plants 
are restricted to the Virgin Limestone M ember, 
Schnabkaib Member and Upper Red Member of the 
Moenkopi Formation , and  sporadically  on the Chinle 
Shale Formation  (USDI -FWS, 2006a) . Soils are very 
gravelly or very cobbly sandy  loams with 3 to 40% 
slopes in  an area receiving an average of 16.5 cm (6.5 
in) of annual precipitation  (WRCC, 2011).

Management 
The greatest threat to Holmgren milkvetch is habitat 
loss due to urban expansion. Many of the known 
populations exist in areas targeted for development. 
Designation of critical habitat and BLM land trades 
can potentially ameliorate some of these threats; 
however development of new surface roads,  power 
transmission lines, and water pipelines pose further 
challenges. Habitat fragmentation caused by these 
developments can additionally have a negative 
impact on pollination and genetic interchange (USDI -
FWS, 2006a).  
 
Habitat degradation caused by off road vehicle 
(ORV) use and cattle trampling continues to threaten 
Holmgren milkvetch. ORV use in Utah increased 
437% in Washington County, Utah from 1998 to 
2006 (USDI -FWS, 2006a). ORVs and cattle can 
damage plants and destroy soil properties necessary 
for  Holmgren milkvetch habitat. All known 
Holmgren milkvetch populations are currently under 
threat from ORV use.  
 
The explosive increase in invasive weeds could 
potentially have a drastic effect upon Holmgren 
milkvetch habitat. Invasive annual grasses such a s 
cheatgrass ( Bromus tectorum ) and red brome ( B. 
rubens ) can grow in densities sufficient to carry fires 
throughout the limited habitat and can cause 
permanent changes in the plant community (USDI -
FWS, 2006a ).

associated with  Holmgren milkvetch. 
 
Environmental Concerns  
There are no known environmental concerns  
associated with  Holmgren milkvetch. 
 
Seed and Plant Production  
Holmgren milkvetch exhibits low survival in the first 
growing season with few plants surviving into their 
second year (Van Buren and Harper, 2003).  
Flowering occurs between March and April with fruit 
set by the end of April. Seed pods are visible through 
May  before the plants senesce for the summer (Van 
Buren  and Harper, 2003a). The flowers are pollinated 
primarily by native bee species including: 
Anthophora poterae, Eucera quadricincta, Osmia 
titusi  and two Dialictus  species (Tepedino, 2005). 
Pollinated fruit contain on average 25 seeds 
(Stubben, 1997).
