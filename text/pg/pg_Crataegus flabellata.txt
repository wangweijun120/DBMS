FANLEAF 
HAWTHORN  
Crataegus flabellata  (Spach) 
Kirchn.  
Plant Symbol = CRFL  
 
Contributed By: USDA NRCS National Plant Data 
Center 
 
Uses 
Erosion Control: Because it tolerates a wide variety 
of sites, it can be planted to stabilize banks, for 
shelterbelts, and for erosion control. 
 
Timber : Although the wood is hard and strong, it has 
no commercial value exce pt for tool handles and 
other small items. 
 
Wildlife : It provides excellent food and cover for 
wildlife. 
 
Beautification : Excellent for environmental plantings 
including small specimen  tree and shrub border. 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status, such as, state noxious status, and 
wetland indicator values. 
 
Description 
General: Fanleaf hawthorn is a shrub or small tree 
that grows to thirty feet ta ll and seven inches in DBH, 
with thorns 1.2-1.6 inches along the branchlets.  
Leaves are broadest near the base to the mid-section, 
sometimes triangular shaped, lobed, hairy at first 
becoming smooth at maturity.  Flowers are in clusters 
of three to fifteen.  Fruits are globe shaped to 
broadest above the mid-section, usually bright red 
with juicy flesh.  
 from Britton & Brown 1913 by Kentucky Native Plant Society @ PLANTS
 
Distribution : Fanleaf hawthorn grows from 
northeastern North America to South Carolina and 
Louisiana. 
 
Adaptation 
Although fanleaf hawthorn will succeed in partial 
shade and different soil types, it grows best in full 
sunlight and well-drained loamy soils.  It will tolerate 
wet soils before becoming drought tolerant once 
established.  It is also wind tolerant making it a good 
tree species in shelterbelt planting.  It is also tolerant 
of atmospheric pollution and performs well in urban 
settings. 
 
Establishment  
Propagation from Seed or Grafting : Fanleaf 
hawthorn can be propagated by either seeds or 
grafting.  Successful propagation using seeds requires 
acid scarification followed by warm stratification and 
prechilling.  Seeds, whose numbers per lb. varies 
with species, are planted early in the fall, in drill rows 
eight to twelve inches apart and covered with 1/4 
inch of soil.  Seedlings must not be kept in the 
nursery longer than a year.  
 
Containerized trees should be planted when they are 
no more than eight feet tall, in the fall or spring.  
Balled and burlapped trees should be planted in early 
spring. 
 
Grafting on seedling stock of  Crataegus oxyacantha 
or  Crataegus monogyna  is best carried out in the 
winter to early spring.

Management 
Pruning should be done in the winter or early spring 
in order to maintain a clear shoot leader on young 
trees and/or remove the weakest branches to allow 
more light to pass through.  Suckers or stems arising 
from the roots should be removed when they become 
noticeable. 
 
Pest and Potential Problems 
Although insects and diseases seldom affect fanleaf 
hawthorn; however, it is susceptible to fireblight, 
cedar-hawthorn rust, cedar-quince rust, leaf blight, 
fruit rot, and leaf spot. 
 
Cultivars, Improved and Selected Materials (and 
area of origin) 
Consult you local nurseries to choose the right 
cultivar for your specific landscape.  Contact your 
local Natural Resources Conservation Service 
(formerly Soil Conservation Service) office for more 
information.  Look in the phone book under ”United 
States Government.”  The Natural Resources 
Conservation Service will be listed under the 
subheading “Departmen t of Agriculture.”
