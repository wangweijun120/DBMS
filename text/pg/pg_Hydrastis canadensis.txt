Cultivating the increasingly popular medicinal plant, 
goldenseal: Review and update 
Adrianne Sinclair and Paul M. Catling 
 
Abstract.  Interest in the cultivation of goldenseal is 
increasing and this may have benefits for agriculture, 
human health, and conservation. To enable a better 
understanding of growing conditions, cultivation 
methods reported in the literature were reviewed, 21 
natural goldenseal populations in the northern 
portion of its natural range in North America were 
described and analyzed in terms of population size 
and health, and 15 successful growers were 
interviewed on requirements for optimal cultivation. 
Growing conditions in the wild were compared to 
those reported in the cultivation literature. Summary 
of data from natural populations suggests goldenseal 
grows best in mixed hardwood forests, under 60-65% 
shade, in moist sandy loam soils high in organic 
matter, with pH 5.7 to 6.3. Similarly, review of the 
literature suggests that goldenseal grows best in 
moist, well-drained loams high in organic matter, 
with pH 5.5 to 6.5. Reported shade requirements vary 
but 47-80% shade is considered optimal. Growing 
conditions reported by growers were also consistent 
with the cultivation literature and similar to 
conditions of wild populations. Although optimal 
growing conditions are similar to those for many 
crops, goldenseal is relatively robust and can grow 
well in a variety of conditions including wet, 
predominantly sandy or clay soils with pH as low as 
4.8 and as high as 7.8. Cultivation can utilize a 
ginseng crop infrastructure and goldenseal has been 
recommended as a rotation crop for ginseng. 
Commercial production of goldenseal is potentially 
advantageous because (1) it is an environmentally 
friendly crop; (2) it has been grown successfully far 
outside its natural range, is easy to grow, and is 
considered potentially profitable; and (3) it is 
relatively inexpensive, having low energy, land area, 
and fertilization requirements. Development of a 
sustainable crop may contribute to the protection of 
native wild gennplasm, which can provide valuable 
material for crop improvement.

Introduction 
Goldenseal  (Hydrastis canadensis L .) is a North 
American woodland herb with a yellow perennial

rhizome. A new stem grows each year about 30 cm 
high. The leaves are large (up to 30 cm wide), usually 
with five lobes. A single white flower, a mass of 
stamens with no petals, is produced from late April to 
May, depending on latitude and altitude, followed in 
July by a bright red berry with 10 to 30 black seeds. 
The natural range of the plant extends from southern 
New England west through the extreme southwestern 
portion of southern Ontario, to southern Wisconsin, 
and south to Arkansas and northern Georgia. 
Goldenseal is highly valued for its rhizome and 
roots that contain medicinal alkaloids (Small and 
Catling, 1999). The roots have antibiotic properties, 
suppressing certain bacteria, protozoans, and fungi, 
and are used to treat AIDS and other severe chronic 
diseases, and digestive disorders, and to enhance the 
immune system (Davis and Bit, 1998). Commercial 
formulations prepared from the plant are widely used 
to treat colds and nasal congestion, as well as certain 
infections and parasites (Small and Calling, 1999). 
 
Increasing popularity 
Previously available only in specialty health and 
natural foods stores, goldenseal and other medicinal 
herbs became part of the general marketplace during 
the 1990s, and since then the demand has been 
increasing dramatically (Fos ter, 2000). Between 1991 
and 1996, the wholesale value of goldenseal in the 
U.S. increased by as much as 600% (Robbins, 1996). 
Since 1994 goldenseal has been one of the top six 
best-selling medicinal herbs in the U.S. (Robbins, 
1996; Small and Catling, 1999), and remains so today 
(Foster, 2000). Between 1995 and 1997, the 
medicinal plant market as  a whole, as well as demand 
for goldenseal, experienced in excess of a 30% 
growth rate (USFWS, 1997). Goldenseal is also 
available in numerous drug products (Small and 
Catling, 1999) and in a wide array of herbal products 
on international markets, e.g., in France, Australia, 
Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, and other 
European countries (IUCN, 1997; Robbins, 1996). 
Since demand has increased greatly, and supplies 
have declined, the price of goldenseal has increased 
dramatically. In the early  1990s, the price of 
goldenseal ranged from $18 to $24 per kg (Foster, 
2000). In 1999, the price ranged from $66 to $110 
per kg (Davis, 1999c; Foster, 2000). In 2000, the 
price of goldenseal was over  $110 per kg, with some 
companies charging over $220 per kg (Foster, 2000; 
Price lists on World Wide Web). The current 
goldenseal shortage and the large increase in its 
demand appear to highlight the need for cultivated 
supplies to satisfy a growing domestic and 
international market (Foster, 2000). 
 
Cultivation and conservation 
Goldenseal is perceived to be at high risk of 
extinction due to excessive harvesting of wild 
populations to supply the market. The Nature 
Conservancy (U.S.) has assigned the plant a national 
rank of N4 and a global rank of G4, indicating that it 
is not susceptible to immediate threat; however, 
goldenseal is considered endangered, critically 
imperiled, imperiled, rare, or uncommon in all 27 
U.S. states having native populations (USFWS, 
1997). In Canada, goldenseal is considered 
threatened due to increasing potential for 
unrestrained wild harvest, as well as habitat loss 
(Sinclair and Catling, 2000a; White, 1991). Globally, 
goldenseal was added to Appendix 11 of CITES 
(Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
Species) in 1997 (CITES, 2000), which requires that 
goldenseal be artificially propagated for export 
(Environment Canada, 1999) and that national and 
international trade in roots, rhizomes, rootstocks, and 
bulk powdered herb will become more tightly 
regulated. 
The actual risk of over-harvest eliminating wild 
populations is dependent on market conditions, as 
well as ecological characteristics. Increased 
cultivation may soon reduce the price of goldenseal 
to the point where collection of wild plants is not a 
threat to survival; however,  this point is best reached 
before wild germplasm is lost. Results from a 1999 
American Herbal Product s Association survey 
(McGuffin, 1999) are encouraging in suggesting that 
the goldenseal market is in transition from wild to 
cultivated sources. Projections suggest that 37 Mg 
will come from cultivated sources in 2000 and reach 
90 Mg or more after 2003. In terms of goldenseal 
ecology, the long-term effects of digging wild roots 
are unknown. Although ther e are abundant anecdotal 
references to a decline after digging (e.g., USFWS, 
1997), there is also evidence  for a beneficial effect of 
some level of soil disturbance (Sinclair and Catling, 
2000b). While removal of large plants may reduce 
seed production, soil disturbance may allow increases 
in patch size in the long  run, since goldenseal can 
produce new plants from  root pieces and tips. 
 
Objectives 
Until the late 1990s, there was very little detailed 
information available on cultivation methods of 
goldenseal. Davis (1996a) summarized information 
from available literature (Foster, 1991; Haage and 
Ballard, 1989; Hardacre et al., 1962; Lloyd, 1912; 
Van Fleet, 1914; Veninga and Zaricor, 1976), and 
from farm and research station demonstrations, 
growers, and collectors. Davis (1999a) noted that 
many of the current recommendations for goldenseal 
cultivation are surprisingly consistent with those

found in a 1914 USDA Farmers' Bulletin (Van Fleet, 
1914), which was updated and released again in 1949 
(Sievers, 1949). Over the past few years there has 
been a surge in research and interest in the cultivation 
of goldenseal, which has resulted in numerous 
publications from a wide range of sources, including 
universities, government agencies, commercial 
growers, public conferences, associations, and private 
researchers. 
Our objectives are to (1) review information on 
goldenseal growth, from the literature and from a 
survey of goldenseal growers, and (2) present new 
information on natural populations. We hope this will 
increase interest in cultivation of goldenseal, and thus 
reduce the actual and perceived threat of 
over-harvest. 
Methods 
To gather information on optimal conditions for 
goldenseal growth, a literatu re search was conducted, 
using the keyword "goldenseal" alone and in 
combination with "cultivation," "farming," 
"propagation," and others, in five major sources: (1) 
AGRICOLA (bibliographic database for the National 
Agricultural Library and other institutions in 
agricultural and related sciences); (2) AGRIS 
(International System for the Agricultural Sciences 
and Technology); (3) BIOSIS (International 
Bibliographic Database for the Life Sciences); (4) 
CUBE (Carleton University  and University of Ottawa 
collections, databases of the Center for Research 
Libraries in Chicago, Canada Institute for Scientific 
and Technical Information [CISTI], Norman Paterson 
School of International Affairs/The Institute of 
European and Russian Studie s Resource Centre); and 
(5) the World Wide Web. 
To further characterize growing conditions, data 
were collected in May 1998 from 21 natural 
goldenseal populations occurring in the northern 
portion of the range in Ontario, i.e., the northern part 
of the plant's range in North America. At each of the 
sites, population size (determined by number of 
stems) was estimated by direct count; plant species 
within goldenseal patches and tree species within a 
10 m radius around a patch were recorded; and the 
amount of shade, soil type, and topography were 
noted. A "patch" constitutes a cluster of plants spaced 
within approximately 0.3 m from other plants and 
"sites" are at least 0.5 km apart. Patches give a very 
rough idea of genetic diversity because different 
patches are likely to be genetically different whereas 
plants within a patch could  be identical due to clonal 
reproduction. 
Shade was estimated based on a percentage scale 
indicating amount of canopy through which direct 
light was penetrating. A soil sample, one per site, was  collected from 14 of the 21 sites, by pushing a metal 
cylinder [10 cm (3.9 inches
) in diameter] to 9.5 cm 
(3.7 inches) depth into the soil within a patch of 
goldenseal. Soil samples were transported in plastic 
bags to ACUTEST laboratories in Ottawa for 
standard soil analysis (OMAFRA, 1988). Each 
sample was analyzed for pH, organic matter 
(percentage dry weight lost on ignition), P (extracted 
with sodium bicarbonate), K,  Mg, Na, Ca (extracted 
with ammonium acetate), Mn (extracted with 
phosphoric acid), and Zn (extracted with DTPA, 
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid). For the 21 
populations, soil texture (percentage sand, silt, and 
clay) was based on estimates from the soil sample or 
on local soil survey data. Data on natural conditions 
are valuable because in nature many stresses operate 
and the plant habitat may be restricted to optimal 
conditions. 
Fifteen major goldenseal producers throughout 
North America were interviewed by telephone to help 
to further establish the requirements for optimal 
cultivation. Well known, reliable growers with 
established businesses and 5 to 18 years of first-hand 
experience were selected ba sed on their identification 
in horticultural publications (Adam, 2000; Davis, 
2000b), recognition by researchers and other 
growers, and their records of producing successful 
crops. Information obtained from the interviews 
included farm location, cultivation method, and soil 
moisture, texture, pH, and organic matter. Some 
growers did not want to be identified, and therefore, 
contributors to Table 3 are not named. 
A method developed by Montford and Small 
(1999a, 1999b) was employed to estimate the 
"biodiversity friendliness" of goldenseal, compared to 
other crops, based on 26 criteria related to the 
predominant manner of cultivation (e.g., forest 
conservation; use of irrigation, biocides, and 
fertilizers; energy consumption; proportion of plant 
utilized; and others). The 26 criteria are assigned 
values of -1, 0, or 1, wher e -1 indicates the crop is 
relatively undesirable with respect to the biodiversity 
criterion, 0 indicates the crop has an average or 
undetermined impact, and 1 indicates the crop is 
relatively desirable with respect to the criterion. 
Simple averaging was used to calculate mean score 
(the more positive the score, the more "ecologically 
friendly" the crop). Information was obtained on 
other benefits of growing goldenseal, but no 
particular procedures were necessary to summarize 
these data.  
Results and Discussion 
Selection of forest site or artificial shade structure 
Goldenseal can be grown successfully under an 
artificial shade structure consisting of steel or wood

posts covered with polypropylene shade cloth or 
wood planks (wood lath structure) (Davis, 1996a, 
1996b, 1999b; Konsler, 1987). The structure should 
be at least 2 to 3 m (6.6 to 9.8 ft) high and open on 
the sides, or with a maximum of two side curtains, to 
allow for adequate air circulation and to prevent 
overheating (Davis, 1999b). 
 
Although goldenseal can be grown successfully 
under an artificial structure, some authors (Beyfuss, 
1999; Davis, 1999b) and growers have suggested that 
a forest site is better than an artificial shade structure  
 
 
because the natural diversity and air circulation in the 
forest system help prevent major problems with 
disease and insects. Large populations of natural 
goldenseal thrive in mixed woods with oaks  (Quercus 
spp.), maples  (Acer spp.), hawthorns (Crataegus 
spp.), walnut  (Juglans nigra L.), hickories  (Carya 
spp.), ironwood  [Ostrya virginiana  (Miller) K. 
Koch], basswood  (Tilia americana L.), and ash 
(Fraxinus  spp.) (Tables 1, 2). Similarly, optimal sites 
for cultivating goldenseal are within stands of mixed, 
deeply rooted hardwood trees such as oak, poplar 
( Populus  spp.), walnut, and basswood (Cech, 1995,  
2000; Davis, 1996b, 1999a, 1999b, 1999c; Konsler, 
1987).

Plant species most frequently found associated 
directly with goldenseal in natural populations, and 
thus helpful in characterizing a goldenseal site, were 
wooly blue violet ( Viola sororia Willd.), cut-leaved 
cranesbill ( Geranium maculatum  L.), false Solomon's 
seal [Maianthemum racemosum  (L.) Link ssp. 
racemosum ], white trillium [Trillium grandiflorum 
(Michx.) Salisb.], wild yam-root (Dioscorea 
quaternata J.  Gemel.), enchanter's nightshade 
(Circaea  spp.), inserted virginia creeper 
[ Parthenocissus inserta (A.  Kern.) Fritsch.], wild leek 
( Allium triccocum Ai ton), spotted touch-me-not 
( Impatiens capensis  L.), snakeroot (Sanicula spp.), 
false mermaid ( Floerkea proserpinacoides  Willd.), 
trout lily Erythronium  spp.), and wood anemone 
( Anemone quinquefolia  L. var. quinquefolia ).  Patches 
of bloodroot ( Sanguinaria canadensis  L.), mayapple 
( Podophyllumpeltatum  L.), white trillium, and blue 
cohosh [ Caulophyllum thalictroides  (L.) Michx] were 
often common and scattered throughout the woods 
where goldenseal occurred  (pers. obs.; Davis, 1996b, 
1999a, 1999b, 1999c; Konsler, 1987). The presence 
of these woodland herbs indicates appropriate 
woodland sites for cultivati on. These authors suggest 
avoiding sites where undergrowth is very thick 
because of competition for resources and reduced air 
circulation. However, the most vigorous naturally 
occurring plants (i.e., largest and darkest green) grew 
in a woodland edge where undergrowth was thick, 
and raspberry  (Rubus spp.), spice bush  [Lindera 
benzoin  (L.) Blume], and various introduced woody 
shrubs were common. 
 
Cultivation requirements 
Soil texture.   Of the natural populations surveyed, 13 
grew in sandy loam, 6 in clay loam, and 2 in loam 
soils.  
 
Fourteen of the 15 interviewed growers were 
successfully growing golden seal in loam soils (7 
growers specified sandy or  clay loam, 1 specified 
sandy or silty loam; Table 3). Similar preferred soil 
type has been reported by researchers and 
experienced growers (Cech, 1995, 2000; Davis, 
1996a, 1996b, 1999a, 1999b, 1999c; Konsler, 1987). 
Konsler (1987) and Davis (1996b) state that 
goldenseal tolerates any soil type except heavy clay 
or light sand, but some growers reported successful 
growth in predominantly clay or predominantly 
gravelly soils (Table 3). In so far as soil texture 
contributes to a large population, the largest natural 
populations grew in loam soils (Table 1). The 
healthiest natural population, based on number of 
stems, number of patches, leaf size, and leaf color 
(i.e., health defined in terms of size of the population,  size of plants in the population, and absence of stress 
as suggested by color), occu
rred in clay loam soil. 
 
Moisture.  Natural populations of goldenseal occur 
on uplands in mesic woods, as well as on lowlands 
near rivers in dry mesic to mesic woods (Sinclair and 
Catling, 2000a). Many sources allude to a preference 
for moist but well-drained soils (Davis, 1996a, 
1996b, 1999a, 1999b, 1999c; Hardacre et al., 1962; 
Li and Oliver, 1995; Maskewich, 2000; McLellan 
and Felton, 1998; Merwin, 2000; Reeleder, 2000). 
All 15 growers indicated that moist but well-drained 
soils are optimal for goldenseal growth; however, one 
grower grew one plot of plants successfully in what 
was referred to as "sloppy, muddy" conditions (Table 
3). 
 
According to Konsler (1987), goldenseal grows best 
on slopes that provid e good surface drainage; 
however, 6 growers reported excellent growth on 
level (or slightly sloping) terrain without raised beds, 
and 12 of 21 natural populations (60%) occurred on 
level land. Davis (1999a, 1999c) states that, under 
cultivation, raised beds should be constructed to 
promote good water drainage. Eight of the 
interviewed growers had success with raised beds, 
but seven also had success without them. Davis 
(1996a) suggests mulching with shredded leaves, 
chopped straw, and similar materials, to reduce 
moisture loss and weed growth, and increase winter 
protection. Seven growers reported the use of mulch  
to increase soil organic matter content rather than to 
protect the plants during winter. Disadvantages of 
surface mulch include its removal to allow 
emergence of seedlings and its provision of cover for 
certain pests such as slugs. Current research is 
directed at optimal mulch  selection and it appears so 
far that plants perform best with hardwood and pine 
bark mulches (J.M. Davis, North Carolina State 
University, pers. comm., 2000). Bryant (1977), an 
experienced grower, emphasized the importance of 
preventing the beds from drying out in summer.  
 
When grown under a forest canopy, goldenseal 
usually does not require irrigation, unless subject to  
drought conditions, which cause plants to drop 
foliage and become dormant earlier (Davis, 1999c). 
While some interviewed growers irrigate during 
periods of plant stress, many reported that irrigation 
is not necessary, and a few emphasized "no 
irrigation" (Table 3).

pH.  The naturally occurring goldenseal populations 
occur in soil with pH ranging from 5.4 to 7.8. The 
largest populations were observed in soil with pH 6.3 
to 7.8. Other large populations (>1000 stems) 
occurred within a soil pH ra nge of 5.7 to 6.3. Three 
of the five smaller populations ( ≤ 241 stems) grew in 
soil with pH > 7.4 (Table 1). The healthiest 
population grew in soil with  pH 6.4. Davis (1996a, 
1998, 1999b) found optimal growth (100% survival, 
larger and healthier plant tops, higher fresh root 
weight) between pH 5.5 to 6.5, based primarily on 
experiments with goldenseal grown in pots with 
forest soil under a wood lath structure. Almost all 
interviewed growers reported optimal growth within 
the same pH range. However, one grower in New 
York State (listed in Table 3) reported successful 
woodland cultivation in soil  with pH 4.8. Davis and 
Bir (1998) emphasize the importance of maintaining 
pH at 5.5 to 6.5 because  of the sensitive relationship 
between pH and growth. 
 
Soil fertility.   Soil fertility (nutrients and organic 
matter) data for 14 naturally occurring goldenseal 
populations are presented in  Table 1. According to 
fertility guidelines for native ornamentals 
(OMAFRA, 2000), all populations occurred in soil 
with high organic matter; adequate Mg, Mn, and Zn; 
but low P. Although population size and health are  generally attributed to soil fertility, two of the largest 
populations (>1000 stems) occurred in soils with low 
K, and two with medium K levels. Of the smallest 
populations (
≤ 241 stems), two grew in soils with low 
K, two with medium K, and one with very high K 
levels. The healthiest populations, based on number 
of stems, number of patches, leaf size, and leaf color, 
occurred in soils with medium K levels. Goldenseal 
is widely reported to prefer rich or fertile soils 
(Beyfuss, 1999; Davis, 1996a, 1999a, 1999b, 1999c; 
Kelly, 1977; Maskewich, 2000; Reeleder, 2000) high 
in organic matter (Beyfuss, 1999; Bryant, 1977; 
Davis, 1996b, 1999b; Hardacre, 1977; Konsler, 1987; 
McLellan and Felton, 1998). All 15 growers 
indicated that goldenseal grows best in very fertile 
soil high in organic matter. Most did not quantify the 
amount of organic matter in the soil, but merely 
indicated that it was "high." Other growers stated 
that, based on visual observations, organic matter 
content of their soils ranged between 15 and 70% 
(Table 3).

Before planting goldenseal, it is generally 
recommended that the soil be tested and fertility 
recommendations for native ornamentals be 
followed, if the soil testing laboratory does not 
provide any specific guidelin es for goldenseal (Davis, 
1996a, 1999a, 1999c). If tests indicate low fertility 
levels, addition of organic matter, such as composted 
manure, composted leaves, bone meal or cottonseed

meal, is recommended (Bryant, 1977; Davis, 1996a, 
1999c). Goldenseal does not benefit from addition of 
inorganic N or P, based on a 3-year experiment with 
application rates of 0 to 0.3 kg/m
3 N and 0 to 0.3 
kg/m3 P (Davis, 1998, 1999a, 1999b; Davis and Bir, 
1998). None of the interviewed growers used 
chemical fertilizers, but instead added organic 
material such as leaf mold or composted manure 
(Table 3). Davis (1996a, 1999c) and Li and Oliver 
(1995) stress the importance of avoiding over 
fertilization as it can promote plant disease. 
According to Davis (1999c), goldenseal growing on 
high organic matter soils should be only lightly 
fertilized with an organic source of nutrients. 
Furthermore, Davis (1999c) suggests application of a 
balanced fertilizer at a low rate each spring, and Cech 
(1995), a grower with over  15 years of experience, 
suggests addition of  compost each summer. 
One interviewed grower reported that goldenseal 
"grows prolifically in [the] lime belt between North 
Carolina and Tennessee" (Table 3). However, T. 
Blakley (pers. comm., 2000)  at the National Center 
for the Preservation of Medicinal Herbs in Rutland, 
Ohio, pointed out that there is no proof yet that 
goldenseal will produce more with higher Ca levels. 
In fact, preliminary results  from an ongoing calcium 
study show that application of 2.2 to 5.6 Mg of Ca ha
-
1
 (2,000 to 5,000 lb ac-1) reduced leaf number and 
plant height, increased dis ease incidence, and caused 
earlier dieback (J.M. Davis, pers. comm., 2000). 
 
Shade.   Natural populations in the northern range 
limit of goldenseal were subject to 30 to 90% shade. 
Shade requirements reported by interviewed growers 
and in the cultivation literature fall within the upper 
portion of this range. Interviewed growers reported 
70 to 87% shade as optimal for growth, except for 
one Ontario grower who reported optimal growth 
under 50% shade. Hardacre (1977) successfully grew 
goldenseal under 66% shade; other researchers and 
farm managers report 75 to 80% shade for optimal 
growth (Beyfuss, 1999; Davis, 1996a, 1999b; Li and 
Oliver, 1995; Merwin, 2000). Konsler (1987) 
reported 65 % shade as minimum tolerance. 
Conversely, natural populations thrived with as little 
as 30% shade. The healthiest natural population grew 
under 30% shade in a woodland edge, and one 
grower also found that goldenseal grew well at the 
forest edge (Table 3). The largest natural populations 
(>1000 stems) grew under conditions of 60 to 65% 
shade (Tablet). Although studies are not complete, 
Davis (1999a) reported that optimal plant growth 
occurred between 63 and 80% shade, and the highest 
plant stand counts and survival occurred under 
conditions of 47 to 63% shade. T. Blakley (pers. 
comm., 2000) suggested th at 50% shade may be  adequate in the northern 
U.S. states and southern 
Canada, but in the warmer south, 70% would likely 
produce better results. Davis (1996b, 1999a, 1999b, 
1999c) and Konsler (1987) suggest avoiding 
cultivation sites in forests with no undergrowth 
(possibly it is too dark or dry). In natural populations, 
plant vigor was low (i.e., wilted, discolored, and 
shorter plants) with 90% shade and sparse 
undergrowth, but high (larger, greener plants) in sites 
with an even undergrowth and up to 70% shade. 
 
Propagation.   Goldenseal can be propagated from 
rhizome pieces, seed, buds, one-year-old seedlings, 
and/or root cuttings (Bryant, 1977; Davis, 1996a, 
1998, 1999a, 1999b; Konsler, 1987; Li and Oliver, 
1995; Merwin, 2000). It takes 3 to 5 years to grow 
harvestable roots from rhizome pieces, 5 to 7 years 
from seed (Cech, 2000; Davis, 1996a, 1999a; 
Merwin, 2000), and 4 to 6 years from root cuttings or 
seedlings (Davis, 1999a). Literature sources indicate 
that goldenseal is most easily and reliably propagated 
by dividing rhizomes in 2.5 cm (1 inch) or larger 
pieces, each with a bud and roots (Davis, 1996a, 
1999a, 1999b, 1999c; Konsler, 1987). 
From 24 to 27 August, 1999, at the start of 
senescence, the authors planted 100 rhizome pieces, 
each with at least 1 bud an d numerous rootlets, at 
each of 5 sites where golden seal grows naturally in 
Ontario. Based on analysis of variance, no significant 
difference in growth (leaf width and plant height) 
was found in either spring (4 to 6 May, 2000), 
summer (19 to 21 June, 2000), or fall (21 to 23 
August, 2000) between small rhizome pieces [<2.5 
cm (1 inch)] and larger pieces [<5 cm (2 inches), 
<7.5 cm (3 inches), and > 7.5 cm (3 inches)]. Studies 
on rhizome size (primarily its length) and rootlets, 
with or without buds, show that numerous healthy 
rootlets on a rhizome are important (i.e., little or no 
growth without) and latent buds produce plants when 
buds are not obvious or broken off (Davis, 1998). 
One of the interviewed growers stressed that bud 
size, rhizome size, and num ber of rootlets affect 
growth rate (Table 3). Ease of propagation was 
emphasized by many of the interviewed growers, and 
most prefer to use rhizome pieces that allow earlier 
harvest. 
One grower reported positive results from passing 
goldenseal roots through a wood chipper, scattering 
the pieces over prepared beds, and raking them into 
the soil. Another grower claimed it was impossible 
for a goldenseal bed to be completely dug out 
because root fragments left  in the soil will start a new 
population. Davis (1998) also reports that small root 
pieces left in the soil after harvest produce new plants 
the next year. Some have  had success by simply 
layering rootlet cuttings in a bed, letting them grow

for a year, and transplanting them (Davis, 1998, 
1999a). 
Literature on cultivation (Davis, 1996a, 1999c) 
and information from interviewed growers (Table 3) 
indicates that propagation of  goldenseal by seed is 
difficult and unpredictabl e. Cech (2000) places 
cultivation of goldenseal by seed in the "extra care" 
category (compared to "challenging" or "easy"). 
Germination rates of purchased seed range from 0 to 
90% (Davis, 1999c). Davis (1999b) reports that many 
growers achieve only 30 to 40% germination the first 
spring after sowing. She obtained about 33% 
germination the first year, but up to 94% the second 
year after sowing. Through experimentation, Davis 
(1998) found no effect of extraction method or 
disinfecting treatment on germination, but that 
sowing time and temperature were critical. The 
highest germination percentage was with seeds held 
at room temperature (21 °C) for 2 weeks before 
planting, and the highest germination (up to 88%) 
was with seeds sown in August (shortly after 
extraction), compared to late fall or spring. 
Interestingly, one interv iewed grower emphasized 
that propagation by seed was not difficult (Table 3). 
 
Diseases and pests.  None of the 21 wild populations 
of goldenseal showed evidence of disease or pest 
problems. Similarly, cultivated goldenseal rarely 
suffers from disease or pe sts when grown in small 
plots in the woods (Davis, 1999a, 1999c). Some 
plantings may be affected by botrytis leaf spot and/or 
slugs (Davis, 1999c; Li and Oliver, 1995). Removal 
of affected foliage and mu lch provides reasonable 
control for botrytis (Davis, 1999a), and successful 
methods of control for slugs have been documented 
(Davis, 1999a, 1999c). However, as goldenseal has 
been increasingly cultivated, there are now more 
reports of diseases (caused by  Alternaria, 
Rhizoctonia,  and Fusarium ) occurring under artificial 
shade structures, but not in  the forest (Beyfuss, 1999; 
Davis, 1999a, 1999c).  The more intensive the 
production system used, the greater incidence of 
disease (Davis, 1999b). The  chance of diseases can 
be reduced by proper san itation practices, adequate 
air and water circulation, and avoiding over 
fertilization (J.M. Davis, North Carolina State 
University, pers. comm., 2000). None of the 
interviewed growers reported any diseases or pests 
associated with their  production practices. 
 
Commercial production 
Some ginseng farmers have taken advantage of 
goldenseal's potential as a rotation crop (Merwin, 
2000). Its value results from the perception that 
ginseng cannot be grown continuously due to 
deterioration of soil quality. However, this may be  overstated since soil quality adequate for ginseng 
production can be maintained (T.S.C. Li, Agriculture 
and Agri-Food Canada, pers. comm., 2000). Ginseng 
farmers have noted that goldenseal has similar 
cultural requirements and, 
consequently, there is 
substantial potential profit in taking advantage of an 
existing ginseng plantation to grow goldenseal. The 
raised beds, forest site, or shade apparatus is already 
in place and similar equipmen t can be used in crop 
management and harvesting. It is generally conceded 
that goldenseal is less difficult to grow than ginseng 
because of the greater tolera nce of the former crop to 
higher light intensity, wetter conditions, and diseases 
and pests (Beyfuss, 1999; Bryant, 1977; Cech, 1995; 
Davis, 1996a, 1996b; Konsler, 1987; Table 3). Two 
growers indicated that goldenseal is more tolerant of 
drying out and grows well in much wetter conditions, 
compared to ginseng, and goldenseal roots are less 
likely to rot (Table 3). Goldenseal is not affected by 
the most serious diseases of ginseng, e.g., leaf and 
stem blight caused by Alternaria  panax  and root rot 
caused by  Phytophthora cactorum  (Beyfuss, 1999; 
Davis, 1999a). In fact, goldenseal may be grown 
successfully in locations where ginseng crops have 
failed due to root rot caused by  P. cactorum (Davis, 
1999a). Davis (1998) found that by the second year 
after planting old ginseng beds half with goldenseal 
and half with ginseng, 28% of the ginseng remained 
compared to 80% of the go ldenseal, at one site, and 
83% of the goldenseal was left, but none of the 
ginseng, at another site. Cech (1995) reports that 
some growers mix goldenseal plants in with their 
ginseng to "purify" the soil. One of the growers 
reported use of this strategy (not recorded in Table 
3). One farmer growing both ginseng and goldenseal 
referred to them as "the king and the queen," the 
"queen" (goldenseal) being more robust and reliable. 
 
Current research 
Several cultivation studies under the direction of J.M. 
Davis are underway at North Carolina State 
University (Davis, 2000a). Included are studies on 
factors influencing quality grades (based on alkaloid 
content), propagation methods (rhizome pieces and 
rootlets), seed germination, spacing of seedlings and 
rhizome pieces (5 cm x 5 cm to 30 cm x 30 cm), 
mulches (seven types), and shade (four levels). She is 
also investigating the potential of goldenseal as a 
rotation crop for ginseng in terms of soil 
improvement (Davis, 1998). J. Simon at Purdue 
University is testing whether goldenseal is more 
subject to diseases under  a shade structure compared 
to a forest canopy (Davis , 1998). Research on the 
cultivation requirements of goldenseal is also being 
conducted at the National Ce nter for the Preservation 
of Medicinal Herbs in Rutland, Ohio. Studies include

identification of diseases and pests; importance of 
solar direction; comparison of yield from seed vs. 
rootstock and from raised beds vs. planting in 
ground; light, fertility, and pH requirements; 
mulches; seed stratification techniques; drying 
methods; and storage methods (McNeill et al., 2000; 
T. Blakley, National Center for the Preservation of 
Medicinal Herbs, pers. comm., 2000). Research 
currently being conducted by R.D. Reeleder at 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's Southern Crop 
Protection and Food Research Centre features 
alternative methods of generating planting stock to 
ensure that crops are not established from 
wild-collected roots, to halt decline of natural 
populations. Longer-term goals at this Centre involve 
remedies for pest control (Reeleder, 2000). A. 
Sinclair (Catling and Sinclair, 1998; Sinclair and 
Catling, 2000a, 2000b; Sinclair et al., 2000) is 
studying habitat requirements and effects of 
disturbance that relate to growing conditions and 
cultivation. Two recent conferences (Louisville, 
Kentucky, 9-11 May 2000, and Leeds, New York, 
7-9 September 2000) have raised awareness of the 
potential of ginseng and goldenseal crops. The 
Louisville conference, organized by T. Jones, 
University of Kentucky Extension Horticulture 
Specialist, featured worksh ops to teach growers how 
to produce ginseng and goldenseal under semi-
natural and organic conditions, resulting in higher 
cash value. 
 
Other considerations 
The demand for goldenseal may not reach the point 
of allowing it to become a significant crop or even a 
significant rotational crop in ginseng cultivation, in 
terms of hectarage, but there is little doubt that it will 
become much more widely grown on a commercial 
basis. Considering this possibility, there are several 
benefits of growing goldenseal to bear in mind. 
 
Environmental friendliness.  Goldenseal has an 
approximate "biodiversity- friendly" score of 17, 
making it one of the crops that contributes most to 
biodiversity protection. Its very high score is a 
consequence of various char acteristics such as: (1) it 
requires relatively little agricultural input (i.e., 
fertilizers and pesticides); (2) it contributes to 
protection of wild species; (3) it requires relatively 
low energy for maintenance and harvest; (4) it has a 
high value per ha and relatively low hectarage 
requirement; (5) it can be grown in rotation thus 
reducing the need for agrichemicals; and (6) its 
flowers produce food for pollinators. 
 
Sustainability and germplasm protection. 
Reduction of the increasing threat to natural  populations as a result of cultivation could decrease 
the likelihood of loss of goldenseal germplasm. The 
germplasm may prove valuable in crop development 
if goldenseal gains popularity as a crop. 
 
Low fertilization and energy requirements. Davis 
(1998, 1999a, 1999
b) found that addition of inorganic 
N (ammonium nitrate) and  P either reduced growth 
or had little effect, indicating that fertilizer 
requirements are generally low. Minimizing 
fertilization reduces both actual and environmental 
costs. Less expensive organic sources of fertilizer, 
such as leaf compost, manure compost, bone meal, or 
cottonseed meal, have been recommended by 
researchers and growers  as more effective for 
goldenseal production (Bryant, 1977; Davis, 1996a; 
Hardacre, 1977; McNeill et al., 2000; Reeleder, 
2000). 
 
Availability of planting stock 
Suppliers of plant propagation material are readily 
available on the World Wide Web; however, a survey 
by the American Herbal  Products Association 
indicates that most material is obtained from wild 
sources (McGuffin, 1999). Suppliers and/ or local 
natural resource departments may be able to ensure 
that source material has originated from cultivation. 
Current research is directed at alternative methods of 
generating planting stock (Reeleder, 2000) and 
optimizing cultivation techniques (McNeill et al., 
2000), to reduce collection from wild populations. 
Suppliers are also encouraging growing the plant 
from seed (Cech, 2000). Regional natural populations 
contain characteristics, in cluding local climate and 
pest adaptation, and possibly genetic variation in 
blight and drought resistance, alkaloid content, and 
other characteristics, necessary to develop and 
maintain a viable crop in local areas. 
 
Summary and Conclusions 
There has recently been much increased interest in 
goldenseal cultivation. It is relatively easy to grow 
and may provide a useful diversification crop. At the 
same time cultivation may increase availability of 
this medicinal herb and contribute to the protection of 
natural populations. As a crop, goldenseal is 
considered relatively inex pensive, can be grown 
throughout a large region  of North America, and 
contributes in a number of ways to the goals of 
sustainable agriculture.
