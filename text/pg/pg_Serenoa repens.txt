Alternate Name   Palmetto  
Uses 
Cultural:  Saw  palmetto  featured  prominently  in  the 
material  cultures  of  some  Southeastern  tribes.  The 
Tequesta, Creek, Miccosukee, and Seminole gathered and 
ate the berries in late summer or fall (Bennett and Hicklin 
1998;  Tebeau  1968;  Rusby  1906). Romans  (1999:145) 
said  in  1775  in  reference  to  the  Creek:  “…  they  dry 
peaches  and  persimmons,  chestnuts  and  the  fruit  of  the 
chamaerops  [Serenoa  repens].” The  young,  sweet,  and 
tender  shoots  are  also  edible  (Small  1926).  Naturalist 
William  Bartram  (1996:559),  in  his  travels  in  the 
Southeastern  United  States  in  the  1770s,  noted  that  there 
were “several  species  of  palms,  which  furnish  them 
[tribes]  with  a  great  variety  of  agreeable  and  nourishing 
food”  and  very likely  saw  palmetto  was  one  of  them. 
Evidence for saw palmetto use is widespread in  
coastal archaeological  sites  in  southern  and  central 
Florida,  being  an  extremely  important  food  for  Florida’s 
pre-Columbian peoples (  McGoun   1993  cited  in  Bennett 
and  Hicklin  1998).  The  seeds  of  these  fruits  also  are 
found  at  sites  in  northern  Florida  and  in  the  Lower 
Mississippi Valley (Alexander 1984 and Kidder and Fritz 
1993 cited in Scarry 2003).  
 
The  Choctaw,  Koasati,  Miccosukee,  and  Seminole  used 
and continue to use the split leaf petioles for basketry 
(Bennett  and  Hicklin 1998;  Bushnell  1909;  Colvin  2006; 
Sturtevant 1955:504). Thomas Colvin (2006:80) describes 
the  sustainable  harvest  practices  of  the  Choctaw  that  he 
learned  from  the  Johnsons:  “The  best  palmetto  (Serrenoa 
serrulata)  [now Serenoa  repens]  grows  where  the  marsh 
meets  the  swamp  or  bayou.  When  cutting  it,  I  always 
leave  stalks  with  one  or  two  green  fronds,  as  well  as  the 
center  growing  core  of  the  plant,  as  the  Johnsons 
[Choctaw]  taught  me  to  do,  so  that  the  plant  will  not  die. 
This  can  be  done  twice  each year. Palmetto  baskets  are 
made  from  the  cortical  layer  of  the  stalks,  not  from  the 
fronds.”  The Choctaw  remove  the  rigid  teeth from  the 
petioles  and  split  the  stalks  into  five  or  six  straws,  peeled 
and  trimmed  them  to  the  proper  width,  and  dried  them  in 
the  sun.  They  might  be  then  dyed  black,  red,  or  yellow. 
Sifters, pack, heart, and elbow baskets all carry its leaves. 
The  Seminole  pounded  corn  into  a  powder,  sifted  it 
through  woven  palmetto  fibers,  and  then  placed  it  in  a 
kettle  of  boiling  water  to  make  a  porridge  called sofkee 
(Covington 1993).

The  Seminole  used  the  leaves  for  bedding  in a  temporary 
camp. The  Chitimacha,  Choctaw,  Houma,  Miccosukee, 
and  Seminole  thatched  their  houses  with  either  saw 
palmetto  leaves  or  the  leaves  of Sabal  minor or Sabal 
palmetto. (Bushnell  1909;  Campisi  2004;  Sweeny  1936; 
Bennett  and  Hicklin  1998). The  Miccosukee  and 
Seminole  made  and  continue  to  make  dance  fans  and 
rattles used in ceremonies and toy dolls for children out of 
saw  palmetto  (Bennett  and  Hicklin  1998;  Sturtevant 
1955).

The  plant  provided  punk  for  lighting  fires  and  the  broad 
leaves made a kind of fire fan for fanning fires (Sturtevant 
1955).  Seminole  fish  drags,  rope,  and  brushes  were  made 
out  of  the  palm  fibers  from  leaf  sheaths,  stems,  and  roots 
(Sturtevant 1955:504). 
In  early  Materia  Medicas,  the  berries  were  used  by  non-
Indians  to  treat  all  diseases  of  the  reproductive  glands,  as 
an  aid  to  digestion,  and  to  combat  colds  and  chronic 
bronchitis  of  lung  asthma  (Hutchens  1973).  Today  saw 
palmetto  is  used  to  promote  urination,  reduce 
inflammation and  for treatment of prostate  disorders such 
as prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), an enlarged prostate gland 
condition  common  in  older  men  (Sosnowska  and  Balslev 
2009). Harvesting of fruits from pinelands has heightened 
in the last fifteen years and saw palmetto supplements are 
widely  available  in  health  food  stores  (Carrington  and 
Mullahey  2006).  Although  uncommon,  complications 
from  the  use  of  saw  palmetto  include  intraoperative 
hemorrhage,  gastrointestinal  complaints,  nausea, 
vomiting,  and  diarrhea,  as  well  as  additive  anticoagulant 
effects  and  prolong  bleeding  time  (Integrative Medicine 
Service  of  Memorial  Sloan-Kettering  Cancer  Center 
2008). 
Non-Indian  settlers  split  saw  palmetto  leaves  into  shreds 
and  boiled  them  and  dried  them  in  the  sun  one  or  two 
days  and  made  them  into  durable  mattresses  and  pillows. 
The  leaves  were also collected, dried, put up in bales and 
sold for paper stock in the late 1800s and the strong roots 
were  made  into  scrubbing  brushes  (Hale  1898).  African-
Americans made  palmetto  hats  for  Southern  soldiers 
(Porcher 1991). 
Saw  palmetto  is  often  viewed  as  an  impediment  to  cattle 
grazing and farming (Carrington and Mullahey 2006), but 
there  are  some  exceptions.  It  is  an  important  component 
in the winter diet of cattle in south Florida rangelands and 
sheep  grazing  has  been  used  in  Florida  to  control  saw 
palmetto  (Kalmbacher  et  al. 1984;  Marshall  et  al.  2008).   
One  study  that  evaluated  saw  palmetto  for  biomass 
potential  found  that  the  low  biomass  yields  and  high 
concentrations  of  extractives  and  lignin  indicate  that  saw 
palmetto  does  not  have  the  desired  characteristics  for 
biomass  energy  conversion  (Pitman  1992).  Saw  palmetto 
can  be  planted  for  watershed  protection,  erosion  control, 
and  phosphate-mine  reclamation  (Callahan  et  al.  1990 
cited in Van Deelen 1991).  
 
Wildlife: Ecologically,  saw  palmetto  is  labeled  a 
“keystone  species”  in  southeastern,  and  particularly 
Florida  ecosystems  (Carrington  and  Mullahey  2006). 
Over  100  animal  species  use  saw  palmetto  for  nesting, 
foraging,  or  for  cover  (Maehr  and  Layne  1996).  Both  the 
threatened Florida  panther (Felis concolor ssp. coryi) and 
the  threatened  Florida  black  bear  (Ursus  americanus ssp. 
floridanus)  use  colonies  of  saw  palmetto  as  cover.  Black 
bears  have  their  young  in  the  protective  cover  of  dense 
plants  (Bennett  and  Hicklin  1998).  Florida  burrowing 
owls  (Athene  cunicularia  floridana)  excavate  burrows  in 
saw  palmetto  patches  (Mrykalo  et  al.  2007). Located in 
the  dry  prairies  of  southern  Florida  with  scattered 
palmettos, are two  declining  grassland  birds,  the 
grasshopper  sparrow  (Ammodramus  savannarum 
pratensis) and the sedge wren (Cistothorus platensis), that 
overwinter  there (Butler  et  al.  2009).  Bachman’s 
sparrows  (Aimophila  aestivalis)  use  saw  palmetto  clumps 
as  shelter  to escape  from  predators  (Dean  and  Vickery 
2003).  Beach  mice  (Peromyscus  polionotus)  use  clumps 
of palmetto as cover (Extine and Stout 1987). Cotton mice 
(Peromyscus  gossypinus)  and  golden  mice  (Ochrotomys 
nuttalli)  build  spherical  nests  of  saw  palmetto  fibers 
(Frank  and  Layne  1992).  Saw  palmetto  flowers  attract 
several  hundred  species  of  pollinators  (Carrington  et  al. 
2003).  
In 1898, Hale (1898:8) commented on the “great fattening 
properties of the berries” for wildlife. Saw palmetto fruits 
are  high  in crude  fiber,  potassium,  ash,  fats,  and  sodium 
and  serve  as  an  energy-rich  food  for  raccoons  (Procyon 
lotor),  gray  foxes  (Urocyon  cinereoargenteus),  rats, 
gopher  tortoises  (Gopherus  poloyphemus), opossums 
(Didelphis  marsupialis),  white-tailed  deer  (Odocoileus 
virginianus),  wild  turkeys  (Meleagris  gallopavo), 
bobwhite  quail  (Colinus  virginianus),  black  bears  (Ursus 
americanus),  feral  hogs,  and  various  birds  such  as

American  robins  (Turdus  migratorius),  northern 
mockingbirds    (Mimus  polyglottos),  yellow-rumped 
warblers (Dendroica coronata) and pileated  woodpeckers 
(Dryocopus  pileatus)  (Abrahamson  and  Abrahamson 
1989;  Hale  1898;  Maehr  and  Layne  1996;  Martin  et  al. 
1951).  Fish  and  waterfowl  also  consume  the  fleshy  fruits 
(Hale  1898).  In  Florida,  saw  palmetto  berries  are  the 
single  most  important  food  to  black  bears  (Maehr  2001). 
In Okefenokee, for example,  black  gum (Nyssa sylvatica) 
and saw palmetto fruits were the most important foods for 
the  Florida  black  bears  based  on  scat  analysis.  These  are 
such  important  foods,  they  govern  bear  population 
dynamics  (cub  production)  (Dobey  et  al.  2005).  Florida 
box  turtles  (Terrapene  carolina  bauri)  also  feed  on  their 
fruits  and  passage  of  the  seeds  through  the  turtles’ 
digestive  tracts  greatly  enhances  their  germination 
percentage  and  germination  rate  (Liu  et  al.  2004).  Wasps 
(Mischocyttarus  mexicanus  cubicola)  nest  on  the 
underside  of  horizontally-oriented  leaves  of  saw  palmetto 
in  Florida  (Hermann  et  al.  1985).  Red  widow  spiders 
(Latrodectus bishopi) in Florida scrub build silken retreats 
in  saw  palmetto  leaves  (Carrel  2001).  Mortality  of  saw 
palmetto on restoration sites can be  due  to animal  rooting 
of the forming rhizome by feral pigs (Sus scrofa)  
(Schmalzer et al. 2002).

Description 
General: Palm family (Arecaceae). Saw palmetto is a low 
shrubby  palm  with a  creeping,  horizontal,  simple  or 
branched  stem.  Long-lived,  some  of  the  larger  palms  are 
centuries  old  (Abrahamson  1995).  The  leaves  are  fan-
shaped, up to one meter across, and are divided into 18-30 
segments  (Radford  et  al.  1968;  Hale  1898).  They  have 
petioles  up  to  1.5  m  in  length  nearly  always  with  sharp, 
rigid  recurved  teeth  (Radford  et  al.  1968).  Fertile  ramets 
produce  between  one  and  five  inflorescences  with  small, 
cream-colored and  fragrant  flowers  that  have  three  petals 
and  six  stamens.  The  edible fruit  is  a  drupe,  bluish  to 
black  when  ripe  between  August  and  October,  and 
resembling  black  olives  in  size  and  shape  (Zona  2000; 
Bombardelli  and  Morazzoni  1997;  Hutchens  1973; 
Bennett  and  Hicklin  1998).  Like  all  palms,  saw  palmetto 
has  roots  that  are  mycorrhizal,  enabling  it  to  grow  on 
nutrient poor native soil (Fisher and Jayachandran 1999).  
 
Distribution:  This  palm  occurs  in  Louisiana,  Alabama, 
Mississippi,  Georgia,  South  Carolina,  and  Florida  (Zona 
2000).  Both  William  Bartram  and  Edwin  Hale  wrote 
about the palmetto scrubs extending unbroken for miles in 
the  Southeastern  United  States  (Bartram 1996;  Hale 
1898).  For  current  distribution,  please  consult  the  Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web site. 
 
Habitat: The  plant  is  the  most  common palm  in  the 
United  States  and  grows  in  a  wide  variety  of  habitats 
including  flatwoods,  prairies,  scrub,  mesic  hammocks, 
maritime  forests,  short-hydroperiod  swamps  and  sandy 
dunes  (Bennett  and  Hicklin  1998;  Zona  2000).  Saw 
palmetto  occurs  on  a  range  of  sites  from  xeric  to  hydric 
and  a  diversity  of  soils  from  strongly  acidic  to  alkaline 
(McNab  and  Edwards,  Jr.  1980).  It  is  often  the  dominant 
shrub  in  the  understory  of Pinus  elliottii,  P.  serotina,  and 
P.  palustris flatwoods  (Bennett  and  Hicklin  1998;  Monk 
1965).  Many  of  these  plant  communities  have  evolved 
with  frequent  lightning  and  Indian-set  fires.  For  example, 
upland  Florida  shrublands  dominated  by  clonal  oaks 
intermixed  with  palmettos  and  other  shrubs  have  evolved 
with  fire  (Myers  1990;  Schmalzer  and  Hinkle  1992).  In 
the  absence  of  fire,  it  is  disappearing  as  slow  structural 
changes  in  the  vegetation  result  in  diffuse  ecotones  and 
less  habitat  heterogeneity  (Boughton  et  al.  2006).  Fire 
return intervals in coastal plain savannas are  every two to 
eight  years,  and  one  to  10  years  in  xeric  sand  hills 
(Christensen  1981  and  Glitzenstein  et  al.  1995  cited  in 
Wagner 2003). Flatwoods are dominated by saw palmetto 
and  slash  pines  (Pinus  elliottii)  and  typically  burn  every 
2-9  years  (Schafer  and  Mack  2010).  In  certain plant 
communities, such as the dry prairies of Southern Florida, 
the  absence  of  frequent  fire  can  favor  the  domination  of 
saw  palmetto.  Without  fire  every  one  to  three  years,  saw 
palmettos  exclude  other  grass  and  forb  species  and 
dominate the landscape (Butler et al. 2009).

Southeastern Indians set  fires in the  woods and prairies to 
foster  the  growth  of  important  food  plants,  keep  areas 
open  to  increase  visibility  and  movement,  drive  game, 
increase  palatability,  accessibility,  and  nutrition  of  forage 
plants  for  ungulates,  clear  areas  for  farming,  and  other 
purposes (Stewart 2002).

Several  of  the  habitats  where  saw  palmetto  is  found, 
Florida scrub, longleaf pine forests, loblolly-shortleaf pine 
hardwood  forests,  and  prairies  are  rare  and  declining  due 
to  conversion  to  agriculture,  development,  and  the 
absence or prevention of fire (Noss et al. 1995; Schmalzer 
et al. 2002). Agriculture, both Native American and Euro-
American, resulting in cleared fields, may have kept areas 
relatively  free  of  saw  palmetto  on  Cumberland  Island 
National Seashore, Georgia (Bratton and Miller 1994).   
 
Adaptation 
Studies show saw palmetto not only thrives in a fire-prone 
environment,  but  is  also  activated  reproductively  by  fire. 
Saw  palmetto  has  waxy,  evergreen  leaves  that  are  quite 
flammable.    After  fire,  the  plant  resprouts  from  root 
crowns  and  rhizomes  and  grows rapidly  (Abrahamson 
1984;  1999;  Van  Deelen  1991;  Schmalzer  and  Hinkle 
1992).  Winter-burned  stands  recover  faster  than  summer-
burned  stands  (Abrahamson  1984).  However,  seedlings 
grow  slowly,  especially  on  nutrient-poor  soils,  and  they 
have  a  limited  ability  to  recolonize  former  habitats 
(Abrahamson 1995).  
 
Establishment 
Ripe  fruit  can  be  gathered  by  hand-picking  or  cutting  the 
fruit-bearing  panicle  (Van  Deelen  1991).  Saw  palmetto 
seeds  have  low  and  slow  germination  rates.  In  one  trial, 
soaked  or  imbibed  seeds  held  for  one  week  at  35  degrees 
C provided  the  highest  germination  when  seeds  were 
subsequently  planted  in  sterile  quartz  media  kept  at  30 
degrees  C  in  a  greenhouse  (Carpenter  1987).  D.J.  Makus 
(2008)  found  that  germination  of  saw  palmetto  seeds  can 
be heightened  by  removal  of  any  fleshy  material  around 
the  seeds,  washing  the  seeds,  and  soaking  them  in  water 
for  24  hours  before  sowing  them  in  a  germination 
medium.  Outplanting  the  seeds  in  a  lighter  textured  soil 
resulted  in  improved  plant  height  by  20  percent  and  a 
two-fold  increase  in  fruit  yield  by  the  sixth  year  (Makus 
2008). 
Management 
Because  flowering  is  connected  to  fire,  saw  palmetto 
stands  under  conservation  protection  need  to  be 
prescription  burned  to  maintain  population  viabilities 
(Abrahamson 1999).  Fire  not  only  induces  flowering  in 
appropriately sized individuals, it also influences  whether 
that  stimulus  will  result  in  inflorescences  via  overstory 
canopy  reduction  and  enhancement  of  available  light 
(Abrahamson  1999).  Burning  saw  palmetto  understories 
every  3  to  5  years,  will  maintain  fruit  production  for 
white-tailed  deer  (Fults  1991  cited  in  Van  Deelen  1991). 
Additionally,  controlled  harvesting  of  the  berries  for 
modern medicine will leave fruits for wildlife populations 
that  also  depend  on nutrient-rich  palmetto  fruits 
(Abrahamson 1999). Managing  areas  with  fire  to  include 
both longer and shorter fire  intervals  will create  a  diverse 
landscape mosaic, taking into account old palmetto stands 
that  bears  and  panthers  use  as  cover  for  dens  (Conway 
Duever 2011).

Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin) 
Commercial  sources of saw palmetto seeds are  frequently 
available  (Van Deelen 1991). This plant is available  from 
native  plant  nurseries  and  is  widely  planted  as  an 
ornamental  (Bennett  and  Hicklin  1998).  It  grows  slowly 
though and doesn’t transplant easily (Bennett and Hicklin 
1998;  Abrahamson  1995).  Also  check  with  your  local 
NRCS  Plant  Materials  Center  for  possible  sources  of 
existing plant materials.
