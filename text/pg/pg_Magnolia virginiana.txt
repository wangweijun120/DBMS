Description  
General :  Magnolias  are one of the oldest tree species in 
the world (USNA, 2006).  Sweetbay  is a  woody, 
flowering,  native tree that  can grow up to 60 ft (grows 
only to 20– 40 ft in the North)  on multiple gray and 
smooth stems  (Dirr, 1998; Gilman and Watson, 2014) . It 
may be deciduous, semi -evergreen, or evergreen; and will 
be deciduous in its furthest northern extent. It  grows 
similar to a shrub, with a short, open habit. It can live 
over 50 years. It has slender, hairy  twigs, and the  gray or 
light brown bark  has scales that are pressed together. The 
bark is  aromatic when crushed. Sweetbay is similar in 
appearance to southern magnolia ( Magnolia grandiflora), 
but it has a smaller circumference and shorter height than 
the latter. The 4 –6 in (10– 15 cm) long, 1– 3 in (3–8 cm) 
wide leaves are simple, alternate, oblong, toothless, 
slightly leathery,  with a wedge-shaped base and bluntly 
point apex. Like southern magnolia , the leaves are 
lustrous above and pubescent below, however sweetbay is 
si lvery below, while southern magnolia has a rusty red 
pubescence  (tomentum). The petiole is approximately ½ 
in long (Dirr, 1998). In late spring (May –June)  it 
produces 2– 3 in (5–8 cm) wide fragrant  white, 9–12  spoon
-shaped  petaled, monoecious flowers (having male 
and female reproductive organs on same plant) on 
slender, smooth stalks. The f lowers are pollinated by 
beetles, and open and close in  a 2-day flowering cycle, 
alternating between a female and male pollination phase. 
These separate phases prevent the flower from self -
pollinating, however, separate flowers on the same plant 
may cross -pollinate (Losada, 2014).  The flowers are 
reported to produce a lemon scent and when the flowers 
close they generate heat that is beneficial to the beetles. 
(Bir, 19 92; Losada, 2014 ). The fruit is an aggregate of 
dry, cylindrical, hairy, 2 in long (5 cm) carpels. Each 
follicle contains one 1/4 in (0.6 cm) long bright, oval red 
seed. The seed remains attached to the open pod by a thin, 
elastic thread.  
Distribution :  Magnolias once made up a large part of 
North Temperate forest trees before the last glacial period 
(Maisenhelder, 1970) . Sweetbay grows along the Atlantic 
and G ulf Coastal Plains from Massachusetts  south to 
Florida, west to Texas, and north to Tennessee. Sweet bay 
can be grown in USDA hardiness zone 5b –9  but can also 
be grown in lower Midwestern  states such as  Ohio and 
Indiana (Dirr, 1998). For current distribution, please 
consult the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site.  
 
Habitat :  Sweetbay extends farther north than southern 
magnolia  and it is designated as a USDA facultative 
w etland plant which means it usually occurs in wetlands.  
It will be found in wet, sandy, acidic soils along streams, 
swamps, and flatwoods (Elias, 1980). It occu rs in pine 
and hardwood forest, flatwoods, and floodplains (Gucker, 
2008).  It often grows in the sweetbay/swamp tupelo/red 
maple forest complex a nd is associated with black, water, 
and  swamp tupelo  (Nyssa sylvatica , N. aquatica,  N. 
biflora ), sweetgum  ( Liqu idambar  styraciflua ), water and 
willow oaks  ( Quercus nigra, Q. phellos ), white and green 
ash  ( Fraxinus americana, F. pennsylvanica) , black 
willow  ( Salix nigra), and red maple ( Acer rubrum) 
(Maisenhelder, 1970). It also dominant in bay forests with 
redbay ( Persea borbonia) and loblolly -bay ( Gordonia 
lasianthus ) (Gucker, 2008).  The soils in these habitats can 
be organic, acidic, sandy, saturated, nutrient -poor, peaty, 
or mucky. The soils can be Ultisols, Spodosols, and 
Coas tal Plain Histosols (Priester, 2004 ).  It grows larger in 
the Southeastern US  where soils are richer and wetter 
(Elias, 1980). It is considered a climax species in many 
forest communities.  
Adaptation  
Magnolia  spp. are native to S outheast Asia, eastern North 
America, South and Central America,  and the Caribbean 
(Knox et al. 2013).  Under natural conditions, sweetbay 
se edlings grow in shady to partly- shady hardwood or

coniferous forest understories. Sweetbay is different from 
other magnolias in that it can tolerate saturated and 
flooded soils as  well as droughty conditions . It has been 
shown to survive  flooding and severe drought without 
significant loss of root mass (Gilman and Watson, 2014; 
Nash and Graves, 1993).  It is adapted to lower elevations 
less than 61 m (200ft)  above sea level (Priester, 2004).  It 
grows best in warm climates and acid soils , and is 
deciduous north of USDA Hardiness Zone 8 and may 
exhibit some winter damage in the northern part of USDA 
Hardiness Zone 5  (Dirr, 1998). Sweetbay  is resistant to 
fire a nd can recover from top -kill due to fire, resprouting  
from root crowns, roots, and lignotubers (Gucker, 2008; 
Priester, 2004 ). 
Uses  
Timber/wood:   Sweetbay does  not have a significant value 
as  a timber source, however like southern magnolia, it is 
used for furniture, cabinets, paneling, veneer, boxes, and 
crates (Hodges et al., 2010).  It is straight -grained, can be 
easily worked, and takes finishes well  (Elias, 1980).  
 
Ornamental/landscaping:   Sweetbay is valued for its 
beauty,  open form , attractive leaves,  and its fragrant 
flowers ( Hodges et al., 2010; Losada, 2012).  It works well 
in a shrub border or as a single specimen and can be 
planted next to buildings or in situations with restricted 
space due to its horizontal crown (Gilman and Watson, 
2014).  It would be a good choice for rain gardens because 
it can tolerate saturated soils (Feather, 2013). Currently, i t 
is not as popular as southern magnolia for use in urban 
settings  but has potential for greater use (Gilman and 
Watson, 2014).  
 
Wildlife:  Mag nolia s eed ripens in mid -Autumn and is 
eaten and spread by songbirds, wild turkey, quail,  and 
mammals  such as gray squirrels and white -footed mice. 
Seeds are high in fat and are a good energy source for 
migratory birds  (USNA, 2006) . They are eaten by eastern 
kingbirds,  towhees, mockingbirds,  northern flicker s, 
robins, wood thrushes, blue -jays,  and red -eyed vireos 
(Arnold Arboretum, 2011; Feather, 2013 ).  Sweetbay is 
also  an important plant for attracting hummingbirds 
(KCPD, 2007).  Pollinators, especially bee tles, are 
attracted to the pollen that is high in protein. It is a host 
plant for tiger swallowtail butte rfly, palamedes 
swallowtail,  spicebush swallowtail, and sweetbay 
silkmoth  (Nitao et al., 1992; Gilman, 2015; NPIN, 2014 ). 
Deer and cattle often browse the leaves. The leaves can 
contain up to 10% crude protein content and can account 
for 25% of a cattle’s browse in winter ( Hodges et al., 
2010; Priester, 2004 ). 
Ethnobotany  
William Bartram (1739– 1823) often wrote about 
sweetbay  in the Southeast due to its  natural beauty and 
importance to indigenous tribes (Austin, 2004).  The 
leaves were used as a spice in gravies and tea was made 
from the leaves and/or bark  (Fern , 2010).  It was used by  physicians in the 18
th 
century to treat dia rrhea, cough, and 
fever,  used by the Rappahannock in Virginia as a 
stimulant, and the Choctaw and Houma used it as a 
decoction to treat colds (Austin, 2004). It was also used to 
treat rheumatism, gout, malaria, and was even inhaled as a 
mild hallucinogen ( Fern, 2010; Speck et al., 1942 ; 
Grandtner, 2005) . 
Status  
Weedy or Invasive
:   There are no known problem s with 
magnolias becoming weedy and t here is no indication that 
sweetbay  seed persists in the seed bank  (Gucker, 2008). 
 
Please consult with your local  NRCS Field Office, 
Cooperative Extension Service office, state natural 
resource, or state agriculture department regarding its 
status and use . Please consult the PLANTS Web site 
( http://plants.us da.gov/
) and your State Department of 
Natural Resources for this plant’s current status (e.g., 
threatened or endangered species, state noxious status, 
and wetland indicator values).  
Planting Guidelines 
M agnolias are  moderately fast-growing trees that are easy 
to grow.  Sweetbay  may be propagated through bare root, 
stem cuttings, and grafts. It  can be grown in containers  
and transpl anted into the  field in late winter/early spring 
with a mulch to moderate soil temperature and moisture 
(USNA, 2006).  Seed can be collected in fall, soaked in 
water and baking soda for several days (to prevent 
fermentation) , de -pulped, and stored for 3 months at 45°F 
for the requisite period of cold -stratification (MFC, 2007). 
Afterwards, it can be directly planted in a w ell-pr epared 
seedbed in early spring.  In natural forest communities 
sweetbay seedlings have highest survival rates when 
planted in large openings that are not flooded for  long 
periods (Priester, 2004).  
Management  
Container -grown plants should be transplant ed in spring 
or fall, mulched, fertilized at planting, and well -watered.  
Sweetbay seedlings have greater success when grown in 
part -shade for the first year of establishment (Priester, 
2004).  Applying ½ lb of 10- 10-10 fertilizer at the base of 
the tree in March, May, and July during the first year of 
establishment will accelerate growth (Wade, 2012). Avoid 
fertilizing the tree during its slowest time of growth in fall 
and winter. Continued watering and mulching is required 
for successful establishment, and  many projects with 
Magnolia  spp. have failed due to desiccation (MFC, 
2007).  Sweetbay has a natural conical form and should be 
pruned to this shape. It may grow from several trunks, so 
if a single trunk in desired, prune the tree around a central 
leader.  When sweetbay is pruned in more northern 
latitudes, it  can “fill-out”  and be more shrub -like in 
appearance.  Plants may be coppiced (Hodges et al., 2010). 
Fallen leaves create a persistent residue and can be raked 
under the tree and used as mulch. If there i s evidence of 
leaf spot on the fallen leaves, those leaves should be raked 
up and disposed ( Gilman and Watson, 1994).  In natural

forest communities where fire is not used in ecosystem 
management bay forest communities will eventually 
replace flatwoods, cypress swamps, or white-cedar stands 
(Gucker, 2008).  
Pests and Potential Problems  
Magnoli as do not tend to attract pests, however when 
outbreaks occur, they may result in significant economic 
or aesthetic loss (Knox et al. 2013). There are some 
reports of tu lip-poplar weevil damage and leaf spots on 
young leaves and the magnolia borer can girdle the trunk 
of young nursery stock (Dirr, 1998; Gilman and Watson, 
1994). Magnolia serpentine leafminer moth damage can 
effect plants throughout northeastern states (Kn ox et al., 
2013) and the plant may exhibit chlorosis in Midwest 
calcareous soils (Dirr, 1998). Twigs and leaves may 
occasionally be heavily infested with scales that will not 
harm the growth of the plant but may negatively affect its 
appearance  and it can be infected with verticillium wilt 
(Gilman and Watson, 1994; Gilman and Watson, 2014).   
Priester (2004) reports that sweetbay is susceptible to 
fungal infections of Mycosphaerella milleri (on 
overwintered leaves) , M. glauca (causes circular leaf 
spots on attached leaves) , and Sclerotinia gracilipes  (rots 
flower petals) . Unlike the southern magnolia, sweetbay is 
resistant to Japanese beetle herbivory  (Held, 2004) .  
 
Despite these potential problems, Magnolia  spp. contain 
antimicrobial, insecticidal, and nem aticidal properties that 
help to reduce potential threats from pests and diseases 
(Knox et al., 2013).  
Environmental Concerns   
Native sweetbay populations tend to be rar e at the 
periphery of its range, and are considered endangered in 
New York  and  Massachu setts, and threatened in 
Pennsylvania and Tennessee  (Young, 2013; NHESP, 
2010 ). 
Seeds and Plant Production  
Magnolias  reproduce sexually and are often pollinated by 
beetles.  There is wide variation in bloom times and flower 
set between cultivars. Magnolias can begin producing 
seed  in open areas after 6 years of growth and after 10 
years  under normal conditions ; producing abundant seed 
crops every year after  (Gucker, 2008) . Under forested 
conditions, the initiation of seed production is delayed 
until approxim ately 10–25 years , and in some 
northernmost populations only 33% of the population 
could produce seed  ( Maisenhelder, 1970 ; Gucker, 2008).   
 
Sweet bay  is  propagated  through cuttings or by seed. 
Seeds require at least 2 –3 months of cold stratification at 
32– 41°F and seed germination rates are  50–75%  and up 
to 93%  (Dirr, 1998;  Maisenhelder, 1970 ; Gucker, 2008). 
Generally, germination rates will increase when the 
duration of cold stratification is increased.  Germination 
may begin three weeks after planting. There is 
approximately 7,530 seeds/lb (Priester, 2004). Seed  dispersal in natural communities may occur through birds, 
mammals, heavy rains, and winds (
Maisenhelder, 1970). 
 
Cuttings taken from  softwood material of  young trees can 
be treated with root -promoting hormones and should be 
rooted in a well- drained sand or perlite  (Dirr, 1998).  They 
may also grow though root sprouts (Gucker, 2008). 
Sweetbay is prolific at sprouting after cutting  or stem 
d amage , through root sprouts, or when branches bend to 
the ground ; and it may regenerate as far as 10 ft from the 
parent plant (Gucker, 20 08).  Young seedlings do not grow 
well when inundated for long periods but may grow 12 –
24 in (30– 61 cm) within the first  year ( Gucker, 2008).   
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin)   
Approximately half of the 80 species of magnolia native 
to the eastern US and Southeast Asia are in cultivation 
(USNA, 2006). Sweetbay has been grown in the 
horticulture trade in the US since the 17
th  century , so  it is 
often difficult to distinguish natural po pulations from 
escaped ornamental plants  (Young, 2013).  There are 
many cultivars of sweetbay developed with different 
heights, growth habits, bloom times , bloom abundance, 
and cold tolerance. Generally, when planted in northern 
latitudes it will be shorter and more shrub -like. The more 
cold -tolerant cultivars are ‘Milton’,  ‘Moonglow’, 
‘Ravenswood’, and ‘Henry Hicks’. The cultivar ‘Tensaw’ 
is a hardy,  short, dwarf -leaf, cold -tolerant variety for use 
in the northernmost extent of its range. Its parent tree is 
from Ohio and is less shrubby than many available 
varieties.  Magnolia virginiana  var.  australis  is a variety 
better adapted for the southern US and is m ore tree-like in 
form.  Consult with your local land grant university, local 
extension or local USDA NRCS office for 
recommendations on adapted cultivars for use in your 
area.
