Uses 
Ethnobotanic : Purple nutsedge has been used in 
traditional medicine and in landscaping in China.  
There are reports of its use in India as a soil binder.  
It is undesirable as fodder, because it quickly 
becomes fibrous with age, but  in the absence of more 
desirable plants, it can serve that purpose (Holm et al. 
1977).  Extracts and compounds isolated from purple 
nutsedge have medicinal properties such as the 
reduction of fever, inflammation, and pain.  The 
literature contains numerous references to the use of 
this plant’s roots for essential oils and its seeds for 
food products.  Tuber extracts may reduce nausea and 
act as a muscle relaxant (Wills 1987).

Noxiousness : Purple nutsedge, has been called the 
“world’s worst” weed.  A befitting designation for a 
species known from more countries (at least 92) than 
any other weed that infests at least 52 different crops 
worldwide (Holm et al. 1977).  It grows in all types 
of soils and can survive the highest temperatures 
known in agriculture.  In the United States, purple 
nutsedge infests cultivated fields, waste areas, 
roadsides, pastures, and natural areas.  It is 
considered a headache for  the southern gardener 
because of its insidious, ra pid growth in flowerbeds 
and vegetable gardens.  Purple nutsedge produces an 
extensive system of underground tubers from which 
they can regenerate.  Nutsedge is very difficult to 
control once it is established. 
 
Purple nutsedge greatly impacts agriculture and has 
an unfavorable effect on natural ecosystems by 
displacing native plants or by changing the 
availability of food or shelter for native animals.  
Although relatively small in stature, purple nutsedge 
provides formidable resource competition for much 
larger crop plants and ornamentals.  This rapid 
growing plant can quickly form dense colonies due to 
its ability to produce an extensive system of rhizomes 
and tubers.  Many studies document reduced yields in 
sugar cane, corn, cotton, rice, vegetables, and 
numerous other crops.  The abundantly produced 
tubers present an efficient means of dispersal and 
reproduction.  These feat ures together with the 
ineffectiveness of herbicides  make this weed nearly 
indestructible. 
 
Impact/Vectors : Reduction in crop yields is one of 
the greatest impacts of this species.  In extreme cases 
purple nutsedge can reduce sugarcane yields by 75% 
and sugar yields by 65%.  In Australia, in

experimental plots with cultivation, sugarcane yield 
was reduced by 38%.  In Colombian cornfields, when 
purple nutsedge was allowed to grow for 10 days, 
yield was reduced by 10%.  If allowed to remain for 
30 days, yield dropped to 30%.  Similar dramatic 
effects of this weed on cotton, corn, tomatoes, 
tobacco, mulberries, lemons, and many other crops 
have been demonstrated (Holm et al. 1977). 
 
Rochecouste (1956) noted that even in humid regions 
the production of purple nutsedge shoots and tubers 
could severely restrict water availability to sugarcane.  
Approximate quantities of fertilizer that may be 
mobilized and stored in purple nutsedge equal 815 
kilograms of ammonium sulfate, 320 kilograms of 
potash, and 200 kilograms of phosphate per hectare 
(Holm et al. 1977). 
 
Besides resource competition, evidence suggests that 
organic substances released from the decay of dead 
subterranean tissues may be allelopathic and reduce 
crop yields where purple nutsedge infestations are 
severe.  Purple nutsedge may produce up to 40,000 
kilograms of subterranean plant material per hectare.  
Under experimental conditions, barley yield was 
reduced by 15 to 25% by  Cyperus rotundus residues 
in the soil (Horowitz & Friedman 1971). 
 
Tuber and rhizome production are important factors 
in this species’ success as  a weed.  Rhizomes provide 
the major means by which the plants may colonize an 
area.  Tubers offer a mechanism for asexual 
reproduction, and they are the major dispersal unit 
that can survive extreme conditions.  Tubers make 
the plant difficult to control, because only 
translocated herbicides ar e potentially effective on 
this species. 
 
Rhizomes and tubers form extensive networks in the 
soil.  While most tubers are found growing in the 
upper 15 to 20 cm of soil, a few penetrate to a depth 
of 40 cm.  The root system  in heavy clay may extend 
more than a meter deep (Andrews 1940; Smith and 
Fick 1937).  Under favorable conditions, a single 
tuber could produce 99 tubers in 90 days (Rao 1968).  
Experimental plantings of tubers set on 0.9 meter 
centers resulted in their nearly five-fold increase by 
the end of the growing season (Hauser 1962). 
 
Tubers resist all but high  temperature extremes, but 
seem more sensitive to lower temperatures.  
Germination failed in tubers held for 12 hours at 50
0 
C.  However, greater than  80% germination occurred 
after exposure to 40
0 C.  Tubers exposed to 
temperatures of -5 0C or lower did not survive more 
than two hours (Ueki 1969). 
  
Tubers and basal bulbs serve as vegetative 
propagules.  They are carried on farm tillage 
implements and may be spread by erosion and 
running water.  Severe storms may bring tubers to the 
surface and transport them to new areas.  Such 
propagules may also be transported long distances 
with nursery stock.  Even though purple nutsedge 
flowers abundantly, it rarely produces viable seeds.   
Seeds, although of little reproductive significance in 
the southern United States, are disseminated by wind 
or water, transported in mud, or carried onto fields by 
flooding streams or with irrigation water (Wills 1987; 
Holm et al. 1977).

Description 
General : Purple nutsedge is  a colonial, herbaceous, 
perennial with fibrous roots that typically grows from 
7-40 cm tall and reproduces extensively by rhizomes 
and tubers.  The rhizomes are initially white and 
fleshy with scaly leaves  and then become fibrous, 
wiry, and very dark brown with age.  Rhizomes may 
grow in any direction in the soil.  Those growing 
upward and reaching the soil surface become 
enlarged forming a structur e 2-25 mm in diameter 
variously called a “basal bulb, a tuberous bulb, or a 
corm” that produces shoots, roots, and other 
rhizomes.  Rhizomes that grow downward or 
horizontally form individual tubers or chains of 
tubers.  Individual tubers are dark reddish-brown 
when mature, about 12 mm thick, and vary from 10-
35 mm long. 
 
 © Lowell Urbatsch Leaf bases. 
The dark green, shiny, three-ranked leaf blades arise 
from or near the base of th e plant.  They are narrow

and grass-like ranging in size from 5-12 mm wide to 
50 cm long and have a prominent channel in cross 
section.  The leaf sheaths are tubular and 
membranous and attach to compact nodes at or near 
the base of the plant. 
 
The upright culms or stems are 10-50 cm tall, 
smooth, triangular in cross section, and support a 
much-branched inflorescence.  Two to four leaf-like 
bracts subtend the inflorescence which is umbel-like 
consisting of 3-9 unequal length branches (sometimes 
referred to as rays) bearing spikes of 3-10 spikelets.  
Spikelets are flattened and linear ranging in length 
from 10-30 mm long, and generally dark reddish 
purple or reddish brown in color.  Each of the 20 or 
so flowers (florets) in a spikelet are each subtended 
by a keeled scale (glumes) 2-5 mm long that have a 
green midvein and a membranous margin.  The 
flowers are bisexual each with three stamens and a 
pistil bearing three stigmas.  Fruit, although rarely 
produced, consists of a three-angled achene (nutlet). 
 
Purple nutsedge possesses the C4  photosynthetic 
apparatus, which is an adaptation to assimilating CO
2 
at higher temperatures and higher light intensities 
compared to C
3 pathway plants.  C4  plants typically 
exhibit their best growth rates at temperatures 
characteristic of tropical and subtropical regions.  
The leaf anatomy for purp le nutsedge is of the 
Krantz-type.  Sheaths of  cells that form around the 
vascular bundles serve to compartmentalize the 
photosynthetic events.  Greater anatomical and 
physiological details for purple nut sedge are given 
by Wills (1987). 
 
Cyperus esculentus,  yellow nut sedge, is another 
problematic weedy species that reproduces by tubers.  
It is more widespread and also grows in more 
temperate parts of the Unite d States.  Purple nutsedge 
is readily distinguished from yellow nut sedge and  other sedges by its purplish brown spikelets and scaly 
or wiry rhizomes that often bear chains of tubers. 
 
Distribution
: Purple nutsedge is reportedly native to 
India, but it has been introduced around the World 
(Holm et al. 1977).  The plant is a serious pest in the 
Southeast ranging from Virginia to central Texas.  It 
also has become established in parts of Arizona and 
California and has the potential to invade other 
Pacific states. (Southern Weed Science Society 1995; 
FICMNEW 1997).  This species occasionally occurs 
in more temperate regions.  For example, its presence 
in Stearns County, Minnesota was documented by a 
specimen in the University Herbarium collected by J. 
E. Campbell, July, 1896 (MIN: accession number 
81217), but purple nutsedge has not persisted there 
and other cold locales.  The northern limit of 
nutsedge in Japan is in a region where the average 
minimum atmospheric temperature is -5
0C, the 
temperature below which tubers will not germinate 
(Ueki, 1969).  Temperature appears to limit the 
species to more tropical and warm temperate regions.

Control 
For control measures that are pertinent to your area, 
please contact your local  agricultural extension 
specialist or your city/county weed control specialist. 
 
Mechanical : Moisture loss is detrimental to tubers.  
Tuber death ensued after moisture content dropped to 
15% or less.  Tubers left at the surface of dry soil 
exposed to full sun desicated beyond recovery after 4 
days.  Under simulated field conditions, tubers at 5 
and 10 cm depths in dry soil that were protected from 
rain but exposed to sunlight were killed after 8 and 
12 days at those respective depths (Holm et al., 
1977). 
 
Purple nutsedge tubers can be destroyed with 
repeated summer tillage because of their 
susceptibility to drying.  Infested fields plowed or 
disked at three-week intervals for the entire growing 
season reduced tuber number by 80%.  At four-week 
tillage intervals, tuber numbers actually increased.  
Summer dry fallowing is most effective in light, 
sandy soils but less so in wetter, heavier soils.  
Springtooth harrows are an excellent implement for 
this method.  Such tillage methods are often 
impractical, because the land cannot be used for one 
or more growing seasons.  An exception would be 
where October to June cropping is feasible (Holm et 
al. 1977).

Where tillage is possible, it can give crops a 
competitive advantage.  The use of precision 
equipment to cultivate as closely as possible, and 
hand or mechanical thinning can help to reduce 
nutsedge competition.  Nutsedge is susceptible to 
shading, which reduces vegetative growth and tuber 
production. 
 
Chemical : Purple nutsedge has proved difficult to 
control with herbicides.  To be effective, the 
herbicide must be tran slocated throughout the 
rhizome and tuber network of the plant.  Always 
follow the manufacture’s recommendations for 
application and observe all precautions when using 
herbicides.  Also, observe ap plicable local, state, and 
federal regulations.  A few case histories of herbicide 
control are cited to indicate progress being made in 
controlling purple nutsedge. 
 
Field experiments over a 10 year period were 
conducted at the USDA, Southern Weed Science 
Lab, Stoneville, Mississippi, to determine the effects 
of tillage and herbicide inputs on purple nutsedge 
control in cotton.  Four tillage cotton production 
systems (conventional, two levels of reduced-tillage 
and no-tillage) were evaluated with two herbicide 
(glyphosate) input levels each.  For the most part, 
seed cotton yields were equivalent for the 
conventional and reduced tillage production systems 
regardless of the herbicide input level.  Seed cotton 
yields were less in no-till systems 6 of 10 years 
regardless of herbicide input levels.  It was 
discovered that the timing of glyphosate application, 
as a preplant foliar treatment, was extremely 
important.  Purple nutsedge control decreased (i.e., 
nutsedge populations increased) with glyphosate 
applications 2 to 4 weeks prior to cotton planting.  
When glyphosate applications were made at planting 
in the no-tillage plots, hi gher levels of purple 
nutsedge control were realized.  Based on predicted 
costs of herbicide and tillage operations, no-tillage 
cotton production systems saved monetary inputs and 
increased net profits 8 of  10 years.  Effective and 
efficient purple nutsedge control in cotton can be 
obtained in reduced-tillage production systems, but 
additional research is needed to develop more 
effective systems of purple nutsedge control in no-
tillage cotton production system (Bryson 1996). 
 
In cotton and corn, alachlor (no longer permitted in 
cotton in California due to its damaging effects on the 
crop plants) is effective against yellow nutsedge, but 
is less effective on purple nutsedge.  DSMA and 
MSMA provide control of purple nutsedge when 
applied to cotton as dir ected-sprays after the cotton 
plants have two or more l eaves.  If these herbicides  accidentally get on the 
growing point of cotton 
plants, they will retard th e plant's growth.  Because 
nutsedge is sensitive to competition by shade, early 
chemical control will allow later shading from the 
cotton canopy to provide additional control.  Smart 
sprayers that detect and spray only infested areas can 
save on herbicide costs and introduce less pesticide 
into the environment (Vargas et al. 1997) . 
 
Preplant treatment with the soil fumigant, metam-
sodium, may provide control if applied during 
summer fallow i.e., allowing the soil to remain 
undisturbed for approximately 90 days. (Vargas et 
al.1997). 
 
In four recent studies, a combination of the pesticides 
Telone® C-17 and Tillam® suppresses weeds 
including purple nutsedge, nematodes, and certain 
diseases and achieved yields similar to those obtained 
by fumigation with methyl bromide for Florida 
tomatoes intended for fresh markets). 
 
Nutsedge is very difficult to control once it is 
established in turf.  Therefore, plant in seedbeds that 
are free of nutsedge where  possible.  Small localized 
infestations of nutsedge may be controlled with 
metham or repeated appli cations of glyphosate.  
Maintaining a closed, competitive turf and avoiding 
overly wet soil will help control purple nutsedge.   
Reportedly, Manage® Turf Herbicide does an 
excellent job on yellow and purple nutsedge in lawns. 
 
Biological : Efforts at biological control have 
explored the usefulness of the moth genus  Bactra and 
searches have been made for potentially effective 
fungi, viruses, and nematodes.   Bactra, a natural 
insect enemy of sedges in the genera  Cyperus, 
Kyllingia , and Scirpus , has been considered well-
suited for biological contro l of sedge species (Frick 
& Chandler 1978).  Species of  Bactra are found in 
many warmer regions of the world where purple 
nutsedge is a problem.  Th eir larva feed mainly on 
sedges.  They do not cause appreciable damage to 
their host plants because of delayed seasonal buildup.  
Numbers of larvae remain low until early August 
whereas, large numbers are needed in late May and 
early June to control nuts edge (Frick & Chandler 
1978). 
 
Over a six year period, studies were made on the 
effectiveness of introducing large numbers of adults 
and larvae early in the gr owing season to enable 
insect establishment on nutsedge prior to the time of 
wide use of insecticides in crops (Frick & Chandler 
1978).  The studies were conducted on cotton at the 
USDA, Southern Weed Science Laboratory.

Early-season augmentation of Bactra populations is a 
feasible method for controlling purple nutsedge.  
Large-scale releases would have to use adults 
because of the difficulties and time consuming nature 
of releasing larvae.  Releas es should continue over a 
six week period beginning after crop planting.  
Because of the rapid growth  rate of nutsedge, five to 
ten larvae per shoot are needed.  The number of 
moths to release per unit area would be estimated on 
the basis of a 50:50 sex ratio and an average of 180 
eggs per female (Frick and Chandler 1978). 
 
Cyperus rotundus  is susceptible to rice grassy stunt 
tenuivirus, rice tungro bacilliform badnavirus, and 
rice tungro spherical waikavir us (Brunt et al. 1996).  
Purple nutsedge is an alternate host for the fungi 
Fusarium  and Puccinia canaliculata .  It is also 
infected by the nematodes  Meloidogyne, 
Rotlylenchus,  and Tylenchus .  Leaf scorch of purple 
nutsedge is caused by  Ascochyta cyperiphthora  
(Pomella & Barreto 1997).  However, none of these 
agents causes sufficient destruction to provide 
sufficient control of this weedy plant (Holm et al. 
1977).
