Description  
General :  Foxtail millet ( Setaria italica) is thought to be 
native to southern Asia and is considered one of the oldest 
cultivated millets (Oelke, 1990). It is an introduced, 
annual, warm -season crop that grows  2 –5 ft  (60 -152 cm)  
tall.  The stems are course and leafy, and more slender 
than those of pearl millet ( Pennisetum glaucum) (Lee and 
Henning, 2014). It can form one or more tillering shoots 
(Dekker, 2009).  The yellowish or purplish, 8 -in (20 -cm) 
nodding  inflorescence is composed of a main stalk with 
many side branches.  The seedheads are dense and bristly 
(Cash et al., 2002) and the oval, convex seed grain can be 
a variety of colors.  
 
Distribution :  Foxtail millet is grown in cooler, d roughtier 
regio ns tha n other millets (Koch, 2002 ).  It is widely 
grown throughout China, India, Russia, Africa, and the 
United States.   In the United States, foxtail millet is 
mainly grown in the northern and western Great Plains, 
Midwest , the Dakotas, Colorado, Kansas,  Nebraska, and 
Wyoming  (Oelke, 1990; Baltensperger, 1996).  For current  distribution, please consult the Plant Profile page for this 
species on the PLANTS Web site.
 
 
Habitat :  In most areas foxtail millet is a facultative 
upland plant (FACU) that usually occurs in non -wetlands 
but may occur in wetlands. In the Caribbean it almost 
never occurs in wetlands.   
 
Adaptation  
It can grow in sandy to loamy soils with pH from 5.5 –7.  It 
will grow rapidly in warm weather and can grow in semi -
arid conditions, however, it has a shallow root system that 
does not easily recover from drought (Hancock Seed, 
2014). It can produce one ton of forage on 2 ½ in of 
moisture and requires approximately  1/3 less water than 
corn (Koch, 2002). It has a high level of tolerance to 
salinity (Krishnamurthy et al., 2014). It can grow at 
higher elevations (1500 m) as well as in plains 
(Baltensperger, 1996).  
Uses  
Forage /Feed:   In the United States,  foxtail millet  is 
primarily grown for hay.  Foxtail millet  does not produce 
as much biomass as pearl  millet, but can produce 1 –3.5 
tons/ac  of aboveground  biomass (AGB) (Shonbeck and 
Morse, 2006) and can only be cut once (Lee and Henning, 
2014) . L ike all millets, this species is fast -growing  and  
produces relatively high yiel ds with no danger of 
producing toxic levels of prussic acid (Lee and Henning, 
2014).  However, avoid feeding livestock foxtail millet if 
the plants have be en severely stressed, as they may 
accumulate high levels of nitrate (Oelke, 1990).  Foxtail 
millet can be harvested 75 –90 days after planting (DAP) 
(Cash et al., 2002). It can produce good quality hay when 
gathered into windrows and left unti l fall/winter grazing 
(Koch, 2002 ). Due to its fast growth, it can be used as an 
emergency hay crop (Oelke, 1990 ).  It is easy to harvest as 
hay because of its short, fine stems.  Hay harvesting can 
begin at boot stage, when seedheads are beginning to 
emerge, or from late boot to early bloom stage for 
optimum quality (Cash et al., 2002).  Foxtail millet may 
act as a laxative to horses unless the hay is mixed with 
other roughage (Oelke, 1990) , and can damage a horse’s 
liver, kidneys, and bones due to the glucoside setarian 
( A nderson and Volesky , 2013) . Foxtail millet  lacks some 
essential vitamins and nutrients for swine production 
purposes , so should be mixed with other materials for a 
complete feed . Further information regarding these 
nutrients can be found in Oelke (1990). F oxtail millet is 
similar to other warm -season gra sses in terms of forage 
quality (Baltensperger, 1996).  It performed as well as 
corn in broiler chicken diets and could replace 100% of 
corn in broiler feed without negatively affecting protein 
digestibility or bird health (Boroojeni et al., 2011) . 
 
Natural Resources Conservation Service  Plant Guide

Cover crop/green manure:  Like Japanese millet 
( Echinochloa esculenta ), foxtail millet can be used as a 
weed -suppressing sm other crop. It can be useful as a 
dead -standing  winter cover, or to help suppress weeds 
when used in rotati on after winter wheat (Koch, 2002 ). It 
has a C:N ratio of 44 and can produce  43 lb/ac N in 
above ground biomass (Creamer and Baldwin, 1999). Its 
water -use efficiency is one of the highest of any crop, 
thus making it  a good choice for use in se mi-arid 
environments (Koch, 2002) . Mixing foxtail millet with 
cowpea ( Vigna unguiculata) is a  good cover crop option 
(Creamer and Baldwin, 1999).  When foxtail millet was 
used  in Maryland in a cover crop mixture with soybean 
prior to fall- planted broccoli, the soybean and millet mix 
suppressed more weeds  than the millet alone, had a larger 
total N, and had similar above -ground biomass (Abdul -
Baki et al., 1997) . Sugar snap peas ( Pisum sativum) 
planted with a no -till drill grew well  in senescing millet in 
the Mid -Atlantic region (Myers et al., 2000) ; however , 
Vollmer and others (2010) had less success planting no -
till onions into millet residue in North Carolina due to the 
thickness of the residue . Foxtail millet  residue is more 
persistent than other residue like soybean and buckwheat , 
probably because of its high C: N ratio (Morse, 1995) . It 
can be terminated by  winter-kill,  mowing , or rolling with 
a crimper  during the green seed stage (Creamer and 
Baldwin, 1999).  
 
Critical Area Stabilization:   Because foxtail millet is fast -
growing and produces more biomass than annual rye, it is 
sometimes the preferred choice for restoration of  mine 
lands or steep slopes  (Burger et al., 2009) . 
 
Wildlife:   Many  granivorous  birds are attracted to millet 
and it is often included in  finch and  exotic  birdseed 
mixes.  It is also planted in  food plots for deer, turkey, 
quail, and dove (Hancock Seed Co., 2014).  
Ethnobotany  
Foxtail millet has a long  history of cultivation for human 
consumption  in China  dating back to the  Neolithic Era 
over 4,000 years ago (Baltensperger, 1996).  It is the most 
important millet species currently grown in  China 
(Baltensperger, 1996). It  was once a staple crop in the 
northern Philippines and eventually lost its dominance to 
pond- field cultivation of rice  and  increased production of 
swidden  plots  of  sweet potato (Bodner and Gereau, 1988 ). 
Along with pearl millet  and finger millet, foxtail millet is 
one of the most important millets in the semi -arid tropics 
of Asia and Africa (CGIAR, 2014). In the United States, 
f oxtail millet was not often  or widely  grown until after 
colonial times (Oelke, 1990).  
Status  
Weedy or Invasive
:  The  Setaria  genus as a whole  include 
many invasive weeds that are known for their ability to 
quickly adapt to local conditions (Dekker, 2003). Foxtail 
millet can become  weedy if it is allowed to produce seed. 
It is considered an invasive species in some regions in the  United States, and its use is discouraged in
 Tennessee. 
Please consult with your local NRCS Field Office, 
Cooperative Extension Service office, state natural 
resource, or state agriculture department regarding its 
status and use . Please consult the PLANTS Web site 
( http://plants.usda.gov/
)  and your State Department of 
Natural Resources for this plan t’s current status (e.g., 
threatened or endangered species, state noxious status, 
and wetland indicator values).   
Planting Guidelines  
Plant during late spring/early summer to ensure adequate 
yield.  Soil temperatures should be at least 65°F before 
planting  (Cash et al., 2002). It should be seeded ¼ –½ in 
deep at 15 –20 lb/ac drilled or 20 –30 lb/ac broadcast in a 
well -prepared, fir m seedbed (Hancock Seed, 2014). 
Applying fertilizer will help increase yields, but should be 
done in accordance with soil tests, and  Cooperative 
Extension recommendations for soils/crops in the area.  
Management  
If controlling weeds through cultivation, plant foxtail 
millet in 30 -in rows. If foxtail millet is terminated by 
roller -crimper  without the use of herbicides , residue will 
be more persistent than soybean or buckwheat residue 
(Morse, 1995).  There may be some disadvantage to 
leaving too much millet residue on the soil surface as it 
can impede subsequent cash cro ps or native vegetation 
recruitment in restoration projects  (Burger et al., 2009).  
Like proso millet ( Panicum miliaceum ), there is little 
regrowth after cut ting (Baltensperger, 1996 ). Livestock 
should only be allowed to graze the plant afte r it reaches 
18 in, and before it begins to produce seed (Lee and 
Henning, 2014). Do not graze below 8 in. Generally 
pesticides are not  used in production practices, so there 
are opportunities to grow millet for the organic feed 
market (Lee and Henning, 20 14) 
Pests and Potential Problems  
Summer annual weeds are competitive with millets (Lee 
and Henning, 2014).  One of the most effective  ways of 
controlling weeds during establishment  is to plant foxtail 
millet  seed into a well -prepared, weed -free seedbed. 
Fox tail millet can be stunted or killed by Pyricularia leaf 
spot (Vollmer et al., 2010). Caution should be used when 
planting foxtail millet near wheat, as it is known to host 
the wheat curl mite, responsible for wheat streak mosaic 
virus (Anderson and Volesky, 2013).  Millet may attract 
undesirable herbivores like rodents and deer that may 
browse tree seedlings in restoration sites (Burger et al., 
2009).  
Seeds and Plant Production  
Foxtail millet is self -pollinated and  will produce seed in 
75– 90 days  (Hancock Seed, 2014) . There is a very quick 
transition period from vegetative growth to flower -
development  (Baltensperger, 1996) . Flowering occurs 
top -down on each of the stemmed branches. The seed 
yield of foxtail millet is similar to proso, but the seed s are 
smaller.  It has  approximately 230,000 seeds/lb

(Baltensperger, 1996) . When drilled at 30 lb/ac it can 
produce 4066 lb/ac aboveground  biomass  (Creamer and 
Baldwin, 1999) . 
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin)   
‘Sno -Fox’ is a cultivar developed for use as a grain in the 
United States. Other varieties include  ‘Butte’, ‘German’, 
‘Golden German’, ‘Manta’, ‘White Wonder’, and 
‘Common’ (Cash et al., 2002). Cultivars should be 
selected based on  the local climate, resistance to local 
pests, and intended use. Consult with your local land 
grant university, local extension or local USDA NRCS 
office for recommendations on adapted cultivars for use 
in your area .
