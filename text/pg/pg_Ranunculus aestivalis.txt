Uses  
There are no known human uses associated with autumn 
buttercup. It is grazed by cattle and eaten by small 
mammals.  
 
Status  
Autumn buttercup was first collected in 1894 by Marcus 
E. Jones in Garfield County, UT. It was later recollected 
and described a s a new species by Benson in 1948. 
Surveys made in the 1970s could not locate any plants at 
the original localities and the species was believed to have 
gone extinct  until  1982  when  a small population was 
discovered  1.6 km (1 mi) from the original collection 
location. Monitoring from 1983 through 1989 showed a 
90 percent decr ease in individuals, going from over 400 
individuals to approximately 20  as a result of continued 
grazing and habitat modification.  Autumn buttercup was listed endangered by the USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 
(1989) when it was known from a single 0.004 ha
 (0.01 
ac) population which numbered approximately 20 
individuals.   
 
The species has been assigned a recovery priority of 6 
indicating it as a subspecies with a high degree of threat 
and low recovery potential (USDI -FWS 1991).  In 1989 
The Nature Conservanc y purchased a 44 acre tract of land 
encompassing the existing population and excluding 
domestic livestock grazing. Since that time, two 
additional  small populations have been discovered within 
the Nature Conservancy’s parcel. As of 1991 there were 
an estim ated 200 individual plants (USDI FWS 1991).

Descripti on 
General : Buttercup family (Ranunculaceae). Autumn 
buttercup is a short -lived perennial forb from 0.2 to 0.5 m 
tall. Basal leaf blades are simple with three main lobes 
which are notched or lobed at the tips. The petioles (leaf 
stalks) are 3 to 15 cm (1.8  to 5.9 in) long.  The plant bears 
yellow flowers with 5 petals which are approximately 1 
cm long (Welsh et al. 2003).  
 
Distribution : 
Autumn buttercup is known from a small area along the 
Sevier River north of Panguitch, Utah at 1950 m (6400 ft) 
in elevatio n. Other similar habitats in surrounding areas 
are held by private land owners and have not been 
thoroughly  investigated botanically (Welsh et al. 2003). 
For current distribution, consult the Plant Profile page for 
this species on the PLANTS Web site.  
 
Hab itat:  
The known populations exist in w et saline meadows 
consisting of sedges, rushes and grasses.  Dominant 
species in the community include wiregrass ( Juncus 
arcticus ), sea milkwort ( Glaux maritima) and Nebraska 
sedge ( Carex nebrascensis ). The site  was historically 
grazed by livestock until 1988 (Spence 1996).   
 
Adaptation  
This species is adapted to wet meadows at the transition 
zone between Carex  dominated communities and dry 
upland meadows.  
 
Management  
Early  researchers assumed  that grazing by domestic 
livestock was a major threat to autumn buttercup and
