Uses 
Chalky bluestem is a palatable grass.  It furnishes 
excellent spring grazing and produces high-quality 
winter forage.  This grass establishes naturally on 
muckland soils that have been idle for 1 to 2 years, 
making it a valuable grass for protecting these soils 
against erosion.  It is an indicator of past grazing use. 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plantâ€™s 
current status, such as, state noxious status, and 
wetland indicator values. 
 
Description 
Chalky bluestem is a warm-season, perennial bunch 
grass.  The height is between 3 and 5 feet.  The leaf 
blade is folded tightly; keeled at base but flattened 
toward tip; lower blade is 20 to 25 inches long and 
1/2 inch wide.  The leaf sh eath is keeled, overlapping 
and crowded at base.  The ligule has a membrane 
1/16-inch long.  The seedhead is raceme partly 
enclosed in purplish-brown spathe about 1 inch long.

Management 
Since this grass seldom contributes more than 10 to 
15 percent of total herbage on any site, it is seldom 
selected as a key management species.  It maintains 
itself in the plant composition of grazable woodlands 
if grazing is deferred every summer and proper 
grazing is practiced during winter.  Under good 
management, it is one of the first grasses to become 
established on a range that has been overgrazed.  
Annual burning reduces stand.  
 
Establishment 
Growth starts in mid-January in southern Florida and 
30 to 45 days later in northern part of range.  
Vigorous plants produce leaves 8 to 10 inches long in 
30 days.  Stems, blades, and sheaths are covered with 
a white chalky coating that rubs off easily.  
Seedheads appear in September and early October.  
Seed ripen in October and November.  Chalky 
bluestem is a good seed producer.  Basal leaves stay 
green during winter unless temperature falls below 
20' F.  Particularly well adapted to wet acid or neutral 
sandy soils.  Makes maximum growth on seepy 
slopes.
