Common Names:  Plains p rickly-pear,  hairspine cactus, 
starvation pricklypear, central pricklypear  
 
Scientific Names:  none  
Uses  
Livestock:  Plains pricklypear is palatable to livestock 
once the spines are  removed (Mueller et al. 1994). In the 
Great Plains, plains pricklypear yields can range  from 
1,300 to 1,780 lb/ac. The spines of plains pricklypear 
how ever make it and other desirable vegetation growing 
underneath unavailable to livestock (Smith et al 1985).   
 
Digestibility of despined plains pricklypear measured at 
least equal to that of alfalfa hay. It has less digestible 
protein but more soluble carbohydrates than alfalfa. 
Supplementation with protein is recommended when 
providing a diet of plains pricklypear (Shoop et al. 1977).  
 
Wildlife : Plains pricklypear provides protection and cover 
f or a variety of small mammals, reptiles, birds and insects. 
Other animals including bison, pronghorn and white -
tailed deer eat plains pricklypear, especially after fire 
when the spines have been burned off (Courtney 1989; 
Peden 1976).  
Xeriscape: Plains pri cklypear is easily propagated with 
cuttings and is popular for low water -use gardens and  xeriscaping. The flowers are showy and last from late 
May to late June (Osborn et al. 1986).
 
 
Pollinators : Numerous genera of native bees have been 
documented visiting  plains pricklypear. Osborn et al. 
(1986) observed species of Diadasia, Lithurge, 
Melissodes, Bombus, Agapostemon and  Megachile  
effectively pollinating plains pricklypear in southern 
Colorado.   
 
Ethnobotanical : Numerous tribes used plains pricklypear 
as a food source or as a drug. Cheyenne, Hopi and 
Montana Indians ate the fruit dried or fresh (Hart 1981; 
Nequatewa 1943; Blankinship 1905). The Goshute, Hopi 
and Paiutes also cooked and ate the fleshy stems 
(Chamberlin 1911; Whiting 1939; Fowler 1989). Stems 
and fruit were used to make dye (Hart 1992), and the 
spines were used to make fish hooks (Turner et al. 1980). 
The flesh of the stem joints was used by the Flathead to 
soothe backache, and the Okanagan -Colville applied a 
poultice of flesh to sores and infe ctions (Hart 1992; 
Turner 1980).  
Stat us 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s current 
status (e.g., threatened or endangered species, state 
noxious status, and wetland indicator values).  
Weedines s 
Plains pricklypear  may become weedy or invasive in 
some regions or habitats and may displace desirable 
vegetation if not properly managed (Whitson et al. 1996). 
It is often a problem on overgrazed rangeland (Taylor and 
Whitson 1999). Please consult with your local NRCS 
Fiel d Office, Cooperative Extension Service office, state 
natural resource, or state agriculture department regarding 
its status and use.  Weed information is also available 
from the PLANTS Web site at http://plants.usda.gov/.  
Please consult the Related Web S ites on the Plant Profile 
for this species for further information.  
Description  
General :  Plains pricklypear is a native perennial shrub 
with enlarged photosynthetic stem joints (cladophylls ) 
which function as leaves (Harris and Harris 1997). The 
plants are mainly 1to 2 ft tall and can spread into wide 
colonies by layering and sprouting from fallen segments. 
The flattened stem joints are 2 to 6 inches long, obovate 
to orbicular, with numerous  areoles (localized areas 
bearing spines). Each areole can bear from 0 to 18 spines, 
the longest typically averaging 1 to 6 inches in length 
depending on the variety (Holmgren et al. 2012). The 
flowers are large, 2 to 3.5 inches across, with numerous 
yello w, pink or violet petals.  
Natural Resources Conservation Service  Plant Guide

The fruit is a dry capsule (1 to 2 inches long) which splits 
upon maturity (Welsh et al. 2003). There are 
approximately 145,000 seeds per pound (USDA-NRCS 
2014).   
Distribution :  
Plains pricklypear occurs throughout western North 
A merica. It can be found from British Columbia to 
southern California and east to Saskatchewan and south to 
Texas.  For current distribution, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web site.  
Habitat :  Plains pricklypear occupies  a broad range of 
habitats in western North America. It is found in cold 
desert shrublands in the Intermountain West and northern 
Great Plains and grows in association with sagebrush, 
horsebrush, rabbitbrush, western wheatgrass, bluebunch 
wheatgrass and Id aho fescue (Welsh et al. 2003). In the 
South and the shortgrass prairie it is common in blue 
grama, buffalo grass, threeawn, sand oak, yucca and 
mesquite communities (Shiflet 1994).  
Adaptation  
Plains pricklypear is adapted to arid and semi -arid regions 
receiving 8 to 20 inches annual precipitation at elevations 
from 1,000 to 8,000 feet (Johnson 2000). It can be found 
growing on fine to coarse textured soils but is not 
frequently found on sand dunes. It is moderately saline 
tolerant and is adapted to pH  levels of 7.0 to 8.8 (USDA -
NRCS 2014).  
Establishment  
Plains pricklypear is generally not used in rangeland 
seedings, but is more commonly established with cuttings 
for pollinator and low -water use gardens. See the “Seed 
and Plant Production” section for propag ation details. 
Management  
Removal of plains pricklypear can increase forage 
availability (Hyde et al. 1965). It is often removed from 
rangelands by mechanical beaters. Mueller et al. (1994) 
proposed a mechanical harvester for plains prickly pear.  
They modi fied a side-delivery rake to uproot and 
windrow pricklypear which was then despined (Mueller 
and Forwood 1994) and fed to cattle.  This provided an 
average of 1,040 lb/ac of cactus as potential feed. The 
removal of the cactus also increased the availabilit y of 
desirable forage.  
Pests and Potential Problems  
The spines of plains pricklypear can make other desirable 
vegetation unavailable to livestock (Smith et al 1985). 
The spines are known to cause injury to the nose, mouth 
and tongues of livestock (Burrows and Tyrl 2001).  
 
Environmental Concerns  
The presence of plains pricklypear is often viewed as a 
sign of overgrazing. Colonies of plains pricklypear can 
provide physical protection to more desirable forage as  livestock are hesitant to graze in its vicinity.
 It is unclear 
however if plains pricklypear increases on overgrazed 
rangeland or if it is merely more visible (Bemet 1968).  
Control  
Plains pricklypear can be controlled by mechanical or 
chemical means.  The herbicide Picloram can be applied 
at 8 ounces (1 /2 pint) or 16 ounces (1 pint) per acre. 
Apply at peak of flowering. Use of an oil -water emulsion 
spray mixture may improve control. Application of 
Picloram at the lower rate will provide partial control 
(stand reduction), and the high rate will provide more 
complete control. Treatment response is slow however 
and may take 2 years or more to see full effect (Taylor 
and Whitson 1999).  
Please contact your local agricultural extension speci alist 
or county weed specialist to learn what works best in your 
area and how to use it safely.  Always read label and 
safety instructions for each control method.  Trade names 
and control measures appear in this document only to 
provide specific information.  USDA NRCS does not 
guarantee or warranty the products and control  methods 
named, and other products may be equally effective.  
Seeds and Plant Production  
Plants of plains pricklypear  are typically established 
vegetatively using stem joint segments. Joints can be 
removed from established plants at any time of year. The 
joints should be dried for 2 to 3 days to allow a callus to 
form over the wound (Toogood 1999). Once callused, the 
cut ting can be placed in a container or directly planted at 
the located site. Cuttings will root in 2 to 6 weeks. 
Flowering can occur in the first growing season. 
Establishment from seed is also successful, but seed takes 
1 to 2 years to germinate and years t o develop into mature 
plants.  
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area 
of origin)  
There are no releases of plains pricklypear. Common seed 
harvested from native stands is available commercially.
