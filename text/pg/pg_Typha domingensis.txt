SOUTHERN CATTAIL
Typha domingensis Pers. 
Plant Symbol = TYDO  
 
Contributed By: USDA NRCS National Plant Data 
Center & the Idaho Plant Materials Center 
 
Alternate Names 
Flags, rushes, bulrushes, cat o’nine tails, Cossack 
asparagus, reed mace, baco (cattail) 
 
Uses 
Ethnobotanic: All parts of the cattail are edible when 
gathered at the appropriat e stage of growth.  The 
young shoots are cut from the rhizomes (underground 
stems) in the spring when they are about 4 to 16 
inches long.  The base of the stem where it attaches 
to the rhizome can be boiled or roasted like potatoes.   The young flower stalks can be taken out of their 
sheaths and can be boiled or steamed just like corn.  
Cattail pollen is a fine substitute for flours; it is a 
bright yellow or green color, and turns pancakes, 
cookies or biscuits a pretty yellow color (which 
children love).  The rhizomes (underground stems) 
and lower stems have a sweet
 flavor and can be eaten 
raw, baked, roasted, or broiled.  Cattail rhizomes are 
fairly high in starch content; this is usually listed at 
about 30% to 46%.  The co re can be ground into 
flour.  One acre of cattails would yield about 6,475 
pounds of flour (Harrington 1972).  This flour would 
probably contain about 80 % carbohydrates and 
around 6% to 8% protein.  Since cattail occurs 
around the world, it is a potential source of food for 
the worlds' population.

The Cahuilla Indians used the stalks for matting, 
bedding material, and cere monial bundles (Barrows 
1967).  Some tribes used the leaves and sheath bases 
as caulking materials.  Apaches used the pollen in 
female puberty ceremonies.  After dipping the spike 
in coal oil, the stalk makes  a fine torch.  The fluff can 
also be used as tinder, insulation, or for lining baby 
cradle boards.  The down is used for baby beds 
(Murphy 1959). 
 
Lengths of cattail were plied into rope or other size 
cordage, and cattail rope was used in some areas to 
bind bundles of tule into tule boats.  Air pockets or 
aerenchyma in the stems pr ovide the buoyancy that 
makes tule good boat-building material.  
 
Other Uses : Wildlife, wetland rest oration, wastewater 
tertiary treatment, edible (young shoots, base of stem, 
flower stalks, pollen, rhizomes), baskets, matting, 
bedding material, ceremonial bundles, caulking 
material, and cordage.  The multitudes of tiny, wind-
carried seeds are too small and too hairy to be 
attractive to birds (Hotchki ss and Dozier 1949).  In a 
few exceptions, the seeds are eaten by several duck 
species.  Cattail rootstocks are much more valuable 
as food for wildlife than  are the seeds.  Geese and 
muskrats prefer the stems  and roots.  Shelter and 
nesting cover are provided for long-billed marsh 
wrens, redwing blackbirds, and yellow-headed 
blackbirds.

Description 
General: Cattail Family (Typhaceae).  Cattails are 
herbaceous, rhizomatous perennial plants with long, 
slender green stalks topped with brown, fluffy, 
sausage-shaped flowering heads.  Southern cattail 
plants are 15-40 dm tall.  The spike-like, terminal, 
cylindric inflorescence has  staminate flowers above 
and pistillate flowers below.  The naked axis between 
the staminate and pistillate flowers is approximately 
1-8 cm wide.  The spike is bright yellow-to-orange-
brown.  The basal leaves are 6-18 mm wide when 
fresh, 5-15 mm wide when dry, and are gland-dotted 
on the inside of the leaf n ear the base.  These plants 
are rhizomatous and colonial.  This species is 
distributed across the southern half of the U.S. 
 
Distribution 
For current distribution,  please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web 
site.  Southern cattails are common in the warm 
temperate and tropical regions of the world (Hickman 
1993).  These cattails occur in coastal and valley 
marshes at elevations <1500 m. 
 
 
Establishment 
Adaptation : Cattails are always found in or near 
water, in marshes, ponds, lakes and depressions.  
They are obligate wetland i ndicator plant species.  
Cattails tolerate perennial flooding, reduced soil 
conditions and moderate salinity.  With influxes of 
nutrient or freshwater, cattails are aggressive invaders 
in both brackish salt  marshes and freshwater 
wetlands. 
 
Typha  species may be planted from bare rootstock or 
seedlings from container stalk or directly seeded into 
the soil.  Bare rootstock or seedlings are preferred 
revegetation methods where there is moving water.  
Typha seeds germinate readily and are a cost-
effective means to propagate cattail on moist soils.  
 
Seed Collections : Select seed collection sites where 
continuous stands with fe w intermixed species can 
easily be found.  At each  collection location, please 
obtain permission for seed collection. 
•   Seed is harvested by either taking hand clippers 
or cutting the stem off below the seed heads or 
stripping the seed heads off the stalk. 
•  Collect and store seeds in brown paper bags or 
burlap bags.  Seeds are then dried in these bags. 
•  Seeds can be harvested when they are slightly 
immature.  It is important to harvest the 
staminate stalks before th ey dry and blow away.  
•  Seeds and seed heads need to be cleaned in a 
seed cleaner. 
•  Plant cleaned seed in fall.  
•  Plant in clean, weed - free, moist seed bed.  
Flooded or ponded soils will significantly 
increase seedling mortality. 
•  Broadcast seed and roll in or rake 1/4" to 1/2" 
from the soil surface. 
•  Some seed may be lost due to scour or flooding. 
•  Recommended seed density is unknown at this 
time. 
 
Seed germination in greenhouse : Clean seed - blow 
out light seed. 
•   To grow seeds, plant in greenhouse in 1" x 1" x 
2" pots, 1/4" under the soil surface.  Keep soil 
surface moist.  Greenhou se temperature should 
be 100 degrees F (plus or minus 5 degrees).  
Seeds begin to germinate  after a couple weeks in 
warm temperatures.   
•   Plants are ready in 100 - 120 days to come out as 
plugs.  By planting seeds in August, plugs are 
ready to plant in soil by November.  These plants 
are very small; growing plants to a larger size 
will result in increased revegetation success.  
 
Live Plant Collections : No more than ¼ of the plants 
in an area should be collected.  If no more than 0.09 
m
2 (1 ft2) are removed from a 0.4 m2 (4 ft2) area, the 
plants will grow back in one good growing season.  A 
depth of 15 cm (6 in) is sufficiently deep for digging 
plugs.  This will leave enough plants and rhizomes to 
replenish the stock annually.  Donor plants that are 
drought-stressed tend to have higher revegetation 
success. 
 
Live transplants should be planted in moist (not 
flooded or anoxic) soils as soon as possible.  Plants 
should be transported and stored in a cool location 
prior to planting.  Plugs may be split into smaller 
units, generally no smaller than 6 x 6 cm (2.4 x 2.4 
in), with healthy rhizomes and tops.  The important 
factor in live plant collections is to be sure  to
 include
 
a growing bud in either plugs or rhizomes.  Weeds in 
the plugs should be removed by hand.  For ease in 
transport, soil may be washed  gently from roots.  The 
roots should always remain moist or in water until 
planted.  
 
Clip leaves and stems from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 
inches); this allows the plant to allocate more energy 
into root production.  Plant approximately 1 meter

apart.  Plants should be planted closer together if the 
site has fine soils such as clay or silt, steep slopes, or 
prolonged inundation. 
 
Ideally, plants should be planted in moist soils in late 
fall just after the first rains (usually late October to 
November).  This enables plant root systems to 
become established before heavy flooding and winter 
dormancy occurs.  Survival  is highest when plants are 
dormant and soils are moist.  Fertilization is very 
helpful for plant growth and reproduction.  Many 
more seeds are produced with moderate fertilization. 
 
Management 
Heavy grazing will eliminate  Typha species as well 
as other native species from riparian corridors.  
However, cattails are fairly resistant to moderate 
grazing, providing wet soils are not compacted. 
 
Because cattails have relatively little value for ducks, 
they are often regarded  as undesirable weeds in 
places intended primarily for ducks.  It has been 
found that mowing cattails after the heads are well 
formed but not mature and then following up with 
another mowing about a month later, when new 
growth is two or three feet high, will kill at least 75% 
of the plants.  This will enable other emergent 
vegetation with more palatable and nutritious seeds to 
become established. 
 
Ecologically, cattails tend to invade native plant 
communities when hydrology, salinity, or fertility 
change.  In this case they  out compete native species, 
often becoming monotypic stands of dense cattails.  
Maintaining water flows into the wetland, reducing 
nutrient input and maintaining salinity in tidal 
marshes will help maintain desirable species 
composition.  If cattails begin to invade, physical 
removal may be necessary. 
 
Cultivars, Improved and Selected Materials (and
