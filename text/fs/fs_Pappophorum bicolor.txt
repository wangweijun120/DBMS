Description 
Grass Family (Poaceae).  Pink pappusgrass is a 
native, warm-season, perennial bunch grass.  The 
height ranges from 1 to 2 feet.  The leaf blade is 
narrow; flat or slightly rolled inward, giving a 
threadlike appearance when dr y.  The leaf sheath is  mostly basal, rounded, and shorter than the 
internodes.  The ligule has a tuft of long hairs.  The 
seedhead is a spike-like, pinkish panicle 4 to 5 inches 
long.  The lemmas are somewhat hard and the end is 
dissected into about 12 awns of unequal length about 
as long as lemmas with the glumes transparent. 
 
Management 
This grass is seldom used as a key management 
species.  It responds to proper use and deferred 
grazing during the growing season. 
 From Hitchcock (1950) @ plants.usda.gov 
 
Establishment 
Growth starts in late spring and early summer.  
Seedheads appear about 6 weeks later.  Leaves 
remain green until the early fall.  It reproduces from 
other seeds.  It seldom grows in pure stands and 
grows best on deep loam to clay loam soils that are 
subject to overflow.
