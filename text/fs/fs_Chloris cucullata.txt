Alternate Names

Uses 
Hooded windmillgrass is grazed moderately by all 
livestock and the forage quality is fairly high.  The 
amount of forage produced is relatively low 
compared with that of taller growing associated 
grasses.  It provides fair-quality forage during the 
winter, but should be supplemented with a protein 
concentrate. 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plantâ€™s 
current status, such as, state noxious status and 
wetland indicator values. 
 
Description 
Grass Family (Poaceae).  Hooded windmillgrass is a 
native, warm-season, perennial bunch grass.  The 
height is between 1 and 2 feet.  The leaf blade is 2 to 
6 inches long, folded to a sharp point, and bluish 
green in color.  The leaf sheath is mostly basal, 
shorter than internodes, and compressed or flattened.  
The seedhead is 7 to 12 purplish spikes 1 to 2 inches 
long, clustered at end of stem.  The spikes turn straw  yellow to brownish gray at maturity and the lemma of 
each spikelet has a short awn. 
 
Distribution
: For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site. 
 
Management 
Because of low productivity, this grass is seldom a 
key management species.  When it is, no more than 
50 percent of the current year's growth by weight 
should be removed by grazing.

Establishment 
New growth starts in early spring and stays green 
until fall.  It may produce several seed crops during 
the growing season, the earliest one about June.  
Sometimes this plant has a short rhizome.  The 
windmill appearance of the seedhead makes 
identification easy when flowering.  It is adapted to 
acid to neutral medium- and coarse-textured soils.  It 
does not do well on calcareous or clay soils.
