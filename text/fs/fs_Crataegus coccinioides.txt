Uses   
Erosion Control : Planted to stabilize a variety of sites due 
to its tolerance of various soils and climatic conditions. 
Used in shelterbelts and to stabilize areas from wind and 
water erosion.   
 
Timber : Since it is a rather  small tree the lumber is of no 
commercial value  except to fashion tool handles and other 
small items.   
 
Aesthetics : Produces an excellent small specimen tree in a 
landscape or provides shrub border or screen along a 
property line. It is tolerant of atmospheric pollutants and 
performs admirably in urban  settings.  Foliage turns red to 
bright orange in the fall. Bright red round fruit is also an 
attractive attribute of this plant.  
 
Wildlife: It provides excellent cover and protected nesting 
sites for small birds. In general, the fruits of this species 
are eaten by birds, rodents  and other small mammals. 
White -tail deer browse young twigs and foliage.
