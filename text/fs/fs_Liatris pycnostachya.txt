Uses 
Prairie blazing star can be used for prairie restoration 
and landscaping, roadside plantings, wildlife food 
and habitat, wildflower gardens (because of its 
attractive flowers), and as a small component in 
seeding mixtures. 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status (e.g. threat ened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description 
Prairie blazing star is a ha rdy, native perennial herb 
that grows from a tuber.  It  is one of the most 
conspicuous of the prairie  inhabitants, as its leafy  stems grow erect to a height of 5 feet.  The narrow 
leaves on the lower two-thirds of the plant are so 
crowded that to the casual observer they may appear 
spiraled rather than closel
y alternate.  Lower leaves, 
up to 4 inches long and ½ inch wide, are larger than 
those further up the stems.  Both the leaves and stems 
usually display short, stiff hairs.  
 
The top two-thirds of prairie  blazing star is a spike of 
rose-purple, thistle-like flowers that are given a 
somewhat fuzzy appear ance by extended white 
stamens (male flower parts) and pistils (female 
flower parts).  Flowering star ts at the top of the spike 
and moves progressively downward.  Each flower 
head along the spike is made up of 5 to 12 tubular 
florets.  A dense circle of bracts (tiny, modified 
leaves) surrounds the base  of each flower head.  The 
tips of these long, pointed bracts tend to spread and 
curve back toward their bases.  Bracts of this species 
may have a purplish tinge.  
 
All  Liatris  produce flowers in wand-like spikes or 
racemes.  Their flowers are produced in late summer 
and autumn.  They multiply by offsets from their 
cormlike base, or may be grown from seed, which 
should be sown in autumn.  They will grow and 
produce flowers in poorer soil than most garden 
plants, but thrive best in good, rich garden soil, and 
require no special care.   The showiest species are 
Liatris elegans  and Liatris pycnostachya .  The 
slender seeds of  Liatris are usually less than 1/4 inch 
long.  The seed narrows toward the base and  is tipped 
with a set of soft bristles about as long as the seed 
itself.  There are 10 ribs or ridges running along the 
length of the seed.  Prairie blazing star seeds per 
pound average 131,000.

Adaptation and Distribution 
Prairie blazing star is fo und throughout the tall grass 
prairie biome, often in thick stands on damp prairies 
and open bottomlands from Minnesota and 
Wisconsin south.

Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS 
Website. 
 
Establishment 
Prepare a clean weed free seedbed by disking and 
harrowing or using chemical  weed control.  Firm the 
seedbed by cultipacking.  Seedbed should be firm 
enough to allow seed to be  planted ¼ inch deep.  For

prairie restoration or diverse plantings for wildlife, 
prairie blazing star can be  incorporated into seed 
mixes at a rate of 4 ounces pure live seed/acre.  Use 
unstratified seed in fall and stratified seed in the 
spring.  A seeder with a legume box works well in 
the seeding operation, although other types of seeders 
or drills maybe used.  Apply no fertilizer the 
establishment year unless a soil test indicates a severe 
deficiency of phosphorus and potassium.  Use no 
nitrogen during the establishment year as this can 
encourage weed competition. 
 
Seedling vigor is good and  stands are comparatively 
easy to establish where competition is controlled. 
 
Management  
During establishment, reduce weed competition by 
mowing above the height of the prairie blazing star or 
using approved herbicides.  In established stands, 
prescribed burning may be  appropriate where plant 
vigor declines or where  invader species threaten 
native mix stands. 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Medium to severe lodging has been documented 
when growing prairie blazing star in a monoculture 
planting. 
 
Environmental Concerns 
Prairie blazing star is not considered weedy or an 
invasive species and has not been noted spreading to 
adjoining areas.  Seedlings have not been noted 
spreading from original plantings or if they do 
spread, the rate of spread is not alarming. 
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and 
area of origin) 
Two source identified composites of prairie blazing 
star from northern and cent ral Iowa were released in 
1999 by the Elsberry, Mi ssouri Plant Materials 
Center.  The cultivar ‘Eurek a’ (Kansas) was released 
in 1975 by the Manhattan, Kansas Plant Materials 
Center.
