Description  and Adaptation 
Seaside goldenrod  is a perennial forb that is a member 
of the Aster family.  The plant may grow  up to six feet 
tall at maturity .   The plants alternately arranged leaves 
are f leshy, dark green, oblong, lance shaped  and  are

become smaller up the stem of the plant.  Seaside 
goldenrod derives its name from the numerous bright  golden
 yellow flowers it produces from August through 
October.  
Seaside goldenrod is native and well adapted to coastal 
habitats including the backside of primary dunes, low 
secondary  dunes and edges of salt marshes.   It has some 
tolerance for drought allowing it  to survive in the dry 
conditions  of the dunes. Seaside goldenrod often occurs 
with other native dune plants such as switchgrass, salt 
meadow  cordgrass and  American beachgrass.  The 
range of seaside goldenrod extends from Quebec south 
to Florida and Texas.
