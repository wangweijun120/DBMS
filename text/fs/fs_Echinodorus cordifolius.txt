Description  and Adaptation 
Creeping burhead is a creeping annual or short -lived  
perennial.  The leaves are broadly heart shaped, 2 -7 
inches long and almost as wide.  The principal veins are 
conspicuous and impressed on the upper surface of the 
leaf blade.   The petioles  are  4-20  inches long, enlarged 
and  spongy towards the base.   T he flowering shoot  
(scape) can  reach  3 feet or more in length;  s capes  are 
upright  when young, often drooping and  rooting at the 
tips to produce new plantlets.   Numerous whorls of 
flowers with white petals  and greenish centers are located 
along the  scape. Flowering begins in June and continues  
until  frost. The fruiting heads are round, bur like clusters 
of small brown seeds.  The  native range of the species is 
from Maryland  south to Florida, west to Missouri and the  
panhandle of Texas.  It is usually  found growing in  
swamps,  wet woodlands,  marshes, and ditches. There are 
some  indications that it prefers a slightly shaded  location.  
Bes t growth is generally on wetland  soils with fairly high 
organic matter.
