MARSH 
BRISTLEGRASS  
Setaria parviflora (Poir.) 
Kerguelen  
Plant Symbol = SEPA10

Center 
 Alternate Names 
knotroot bristlegrass, yello w bristlegrass, knotroot 
foxtail, marsh bristle grass  
 
Uses 
Marsh bristlegrass is grazed moderately by livestock, 
usually during the spring and summer.  It becomes 
unpalatable in the fall and provides poor forage after 
maturity.  When grazed for roughage, it should be 
supplemented with a mineral  and protein concentrate.  
Birds readily eat the seeds. 
 
Status

Department of Natural Resources for this plantâ€™s

wetland indicator values. 
 
Description 
Grass Family (Poaceae).  Marsh bristlegrass is a 
warm-season , weak, rhizomatous perennial.  The 
height ranges from  1  to 3 feet.  The leaf blade is flat, 
about 6 to 10 inches long, 1/4 inch wide, prominent 
midrib, and upper surface covered with soft hair.  The 
leaf sheath is  rounded with generally shorter than 
average internodes and often purple tinged.  The 
ligule is  a fringe of short hair.  The seedhead is a  
spikelike panicle, 1 to 2 inches long, and yellowish in 
color with each spikelet surrounded by 5 or more 
yellow or purple bristles.

Management 
This grass is seldom abundant enough to be a key 
management species.  For maximum production, no 
more than 50 percent of  current year's growth by 
weight should be removed during growing season.  
Summer grazing deferments of  at least 90 days every 
2 to 3 years improve plant vigor.  This grass can 
withstand controlled burning if done after September. 
 
Establishment 
It grows from late March or early April until fall 
from short, knotty, branching rhizomes.  Foliage is a 
distinctive whitish green.  The base of the plant is 
slender and wiry.  It produces two and sometimes 
three seed crops during one growing season-the first 
one during May or June.  Bristles are left along the 
seed stalk after the seeds disseminate.  It grows best 
on moist or wet sites.  In Florida, it grows on wet 
sandy soils, sloughs, and acid flatwoods.  In Texas 
and Louisiana, it grows well on salty prairie sites; 
also grows on salt marshes if water level is relatively 
low.
