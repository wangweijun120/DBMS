Description 
Grass Family (Poaceae).  Toothache grass is a 
warm-season, perennial bunch grass.  The height is 
between 2 and 3 feet.  The leaf blade is 1/4 to 1/2 
inch wide, 6 to 10 inches long, pale green on bottom, 
and darker green on top.  The leaf sheath is mostly 
basal and shorter than internodes.  The ligule is small 
membrane with short hair.  The stem, when erect, has 
an enlarged base and contains a substance that 
deadens the tongue and gums when chewed.  The 
seedhead is a curved spike with spikelets sessile on 
one side of rachis, giving it a comb-like appearance. 
 
Distribution: For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site. 
 
Management 
This grass responds to same management as major 
associated grasses.  An abundance of this grass 
indicates good range condition on wet sites. 
 
Establishment 
Growth starts in early spring and again in October or 
November.  The seed ripens in late May or early 
June.  Occasionally, it grows in pure stands.  Each 
plant produces many seed stalks.  This grass produces 
an abundant seed crop the fi rst growing season after a 
burn.  It is adapted to wet, poorly drained, acid soils.  
Typical sites are flatwoods  with clayey subsoil and 
sloughs, which have standing or slow-moving water 
following heavy rains.
