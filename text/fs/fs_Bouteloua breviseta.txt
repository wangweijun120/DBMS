 Alternate Names 
Gypsum grama 
 
Uses 
Cattle, horses, sheep, and goats graze Chino grama.  
Sometimes limited amounts are harvested for hay.  It 
is an important conservation grass, because it is 
adapted to sites on which few other species will 
grow. 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plantâ€™s 
current status, such as, state noxious status and 
wetland indicator values. 
 
Description 
Grass Family (Poaceae).   Chino grama is a native, 
warm-season, perennial bunch grass.  The height is 
between 8 and 12 inches.  The leaf blade is usually 
flat, narrow, 1 to 3 inches long, and curls during 
prolonged dry periods and at maturity.  The leaf 
sheath is rounded, smooth, and overlapping about 
two-thirds as long as the internodes.  The ligule is 
hairy and the stem is solid.  The seedhead has 2 
spikes resembling a chicken's comb on top of each 
stalk.

the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site. 
 
Management 
This grass dies if overgrazed.  It requires a full 
growing season deferment every 2 to 3 years for 
maximum production. 
 
Establishment 
It reproduces largely from auxillary buds at basal 
nodes.  Some new plants are established from seed.  
When growth starts in the late spring or early 
summer, most of old growth greens up, because this 
grass stores nutrients in stem s as well as in roots.  It 
grows in nearly pure stands on gypsum sands and 
highly calcareous clay loam soils.
