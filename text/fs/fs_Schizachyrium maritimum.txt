Alternate Names 
Seacoast bluestem; Andropogon maritimus  
 
Uses 
Conservation plant material for coastal beach dune 
enhancement and stabilization.  Habitat for small 
mammals, shorebirds, and migratory birds. 
 
Status 
This species is ranked on the Rare, Threatened, and 
Endangered Species state heri tage conservation status 
lists in Alabama and Louisiana as an S1 (extensive 
rarity and factors which make it especially vulnerable 
to extirpation), and a global ranking by 
NatureServe.org of G3 (very rare and local 
throughout its range). 
 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plantâ€™s 
current status (e.g. threat ened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description 
Gulf bluestem is a native, warm-season, perennial 
grass that spreads by seed and short rhizomes.  Plants 
are rhizomatous and colonial, stems usually  decumbent, glaucous, reddish, and flattened at the 
base, terminal inflorescences with stalked spikelets.  
Found native to coastal and offshore islands of the 
Florida panhandle west to Louisiana.    
 
Adaptation 
 Establishment 
Gulf bluestem can be successfully established using 
container grown or bareroot plant materials.   
Vegetative propagules from plant division or lower 
stem nodal tissue are used for nursery production.   
Container grown or bareroot propagules should be 
planted on 2-5 foot centers on the primary dune ridge 
and back side and the more stable dune and swale 
areas behind the primary dune.  Interspacing with 
other desirable dune species enhances habitat 
diversity and conservation effectiveness.  Apply a 
blended fertilizer broadcast or slow release tablet or 
packet with each 
plant when planting.  Gulf bluestem 
produces viable seed.  The potential establishment of 
gulf bluestem by seed is being evaluated at the 
Golden Meadow Plant Materials Center in Galliano, 
Louisiana.

Management 
No special management strategy is needed other than 
restricting traffic during the first year of 
establishment.  
 
Pests and Potential Problems
