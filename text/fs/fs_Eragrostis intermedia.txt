PLAINS  LOVEGRASS
Eragrostis intermedia A.S. 
Hitchc. 
Plant Symbol = ERIN  
 
Contributed By: USDA NRCS National Plant Data 
Center 
 
 Alternate Name 
plains love grass  
 
Uses  
Plains lovegrass provides good forage for livestock.  
Its seeds are eaten by upland game birds.  Because it 
usually makes up a small percentage of the forage 
production on any site, it is seldom a key 
management species. 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plantâ€™s 
current status, such as, state noxious status and 
wetland indicator values. 
 
Description 
Plains lovegrass is a native, warm-season, perennial 
bunch grass.  The height is between 2 and 3-1/2 feet.  
The leaf blade is flat and rolls inward under dry 
conditions giving a threadlike appearance.  The leaf 
sheath is mostly basal, smooth, as long as internodes, 
and has a conspicuous line of hairs at the collar.  The 
seedhead is a large and sh owy open panicle that is 
brownish green in color before seed ripens.  The 
spikelets are 3- to 8-flower ed and extend horizontally 
from main stem.  Silver  hairs are found around the 
stem at the panicle base. 
 
Distribution : For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site. 
 
Management 
Proper management of other associated grasses keeps 
lovegrass vigorous. 
 
Establishment 
Growth starts in the early spring.  Because this grass 
has a high seed stalk to leaf ratio, it is a low forage 
producer.  It is seldom found in pure stands, but is 
generally scattered throughout the plant community.  
It grows on dry upland soils ranging from clay to 
sand.
