Description 
Grass Family (Poaceae).  Cu tthroat grass is native, 
warm-season, robust, rhizomatous perennial.  The 
height ranges from 2 to 4 feet.  The leaf blade has a 
narrow keel from 16 to 18 inches long and is twisted 
when dry.  The leaf sheath is mostly basal and 
overlapping, keeled, wide, and cuts back sharply at 
collar.  The ligule has a membrane about 1/32 inches 
long.  The seedhead is an open purple panicle 8 to 10 
inches long. 
 
Distribution : For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site. 
 
Management 
Livestock that graze it in the winter must be fed a 
complete mineral and protein supplement.  Deferred 
grazing every few years durin g the spring for at least 
90 days keeps this grass vigorous and productive.  
Occasional controlled burn ing eliminates unused 
material.  New growth following a burn is excellent 
forage. 
 
Establishment 
Growth starts in January, but little foliage is produced 
until March, April, and May.  It regrows well after 
spring grazing.  The seedhe ads appear in June with 
seed ripening in late July and early August.  It 
reproduces primarily from robust, thick rhizomes.  It 
grows well in 35 - to 40-percent shade and only on 
strongly acid, seepy, sandy sites.
