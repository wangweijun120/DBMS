Uses 
Arizona cottontop is grazed  by cattle, horses, and 
sometimes by sheep and goats.  It is most palatable 
when green.  It cures well on the stem and provides 
dry forage for cattle.  It has been used in range 
seedlings in south Texas following brush control.

Description 
Grass Family (Poaceae).  Arizona cottontop is native, 
warm-season, perennial bunch grass.  The height 
ranges from 1-1/2 to 2 feet .  The leaf blade is flat, 
narrow, and usually less than 5 inches long.  The leaf 
sheath is covered with small hairs.  The stem has 
swollen base, scaly, and hairy.  The seedhead is an 
open panicle.  The second glume and sterile lemma 
are covered with long white (occasionally purple) 
hairs, giving it a silky cottony appearance after the 
seed ripens.

Distribution: For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site. 
 
Management 
To keep Arizona cottontop vigorous and maintain it 
in the plant community, defer grazing 60 to 70 days 
every 2 to 3 years before seed maturity.  No more 
than 50 percent of current year's growth by weight 
should be removed by grazing. 
 
Establishment 
It grows rapidly following late spring and summer 
rains and continues to grow as long as moisture is 
available.  It reproduces  primarily from seed and 
usually produces a good seed crop.  Seed remain 
viable for as long as 10 y ears.  It seldom grows in 
pure stands and grows best on gravelly and sandy 
loam soils.
