Description 
Grass Family (Poaceae).  Sand lovegrass is a 
warm-season, short-lived, perennial bunch grass.  
The height ranges from 2-1/2 to 5 feet.  The leaf 
blade is flat.  It is narrow and rolls inward under dry 
conditions, giving a threadlike appearance.  The leaf 
sheath is rounded, nearly as long as the internodes, 
and hairy an inch or so below collar.  The seedhead 
has a large open and purplish panicle and spikelets 
mostly 4 to 6 flowered. 
 
Distribution : For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site. 
 
Management 
Occasionally, it is included in range-seeding mixtures 
for quick cover and forage production.  This grass is 
seldom a key management species.  It cures well on 
the stem and provides good grazing in the fall and 
winter, if grazing is deferred during summer months. 
 
Establishment 
This grass has a high stem to leaf ratio.  After stems 
are grazed off, they often become stiff and harsh to 
touch.  It can grow principally on deep sands and 
sandy loam soils.
