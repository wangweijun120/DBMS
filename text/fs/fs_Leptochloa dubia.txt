Description 
Grass Family (Poaceae).  Green sprangletop is a 
native, warm-season, short-lived, perennial bunch 
grass.  The height ranges from 1 to 3 feet.  The leaf 
blade is 6 to 18 inches long, usually flat, and 
sometimes folded.  The leaf sheaths are sometimes 
longer than the internodes, flattened, and often 
purplish.  The ligule is hairy.  The seedhead is a 
spreading, open, nodding panicle 4 to 12 inches long, 
consisting of 5 to 20 slender, well separated branches 
2 to 5 inches long.  Each spikelet is 5- to 8-flowered. 
 
Distribution: For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site. 
 
Management 
During the dormant season, it furnishes good quality 
forage, but should be supplemented with a protein 
concentrate.  It is used in range seeding mixtures.  
When this grass is a key management species, no 
more than 50 percent of current growth by weight 
should be removed at any season.  Summer and fall 
grazing deferments of at least 90 days improve vigor, 
increase seed production,  and provide forage for 
winter use.  The seedhead turns pale and droops at 
maturity.

Establishment 
Growth starts about April.   If moisture is scarce, it 
may become semi-dormant in the summer and make 
new growth after the fall rains.  It becomes dormant 
in the late fall.  It may produce two seed crops, one in 
the spring and one in the fall.  It is best adapted to 
deep sandy soils in Florida and to rocky hills and 
canyons in the rest of its range.  It is seldom found on 
deep clay or deep sandy soils in the western part of 
its range.
