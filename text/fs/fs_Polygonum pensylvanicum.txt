PENNSYLVANIA SMARTWEED  
Polygonum pensylvanicum  L. 
Plant Symbol = POPE2 
 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS Plant Materials 
Program 
 
Uses 
This plant is an excellent wildlife food plant, 
especially for waterfowl.   Twenty species of ducks, 
geese, bobwhites, mourning doves, ring-necked 
pheasants, and four species of rails, as well as 30 
nongame birds, eat the seed s.  Dense stands provide 
cover for young waterfowl, marsh birds, and 
wintering pheasants.  Plants and/or seeds are eaten by 
white-footed mice, muskra t, raccoons, and fox 
squirrels. 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plantâ€™s 
current status (e.g. threat ened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description 
Knotweed Family (Polygonaceae).  Pennsylvania 
smartweed is an annual herb that has small, five-
parted pink or rose colored flowers on a short spike.  
It grows 2 to 4(6) feet high.  The flowering branches 
have stalked glands.  The stems have a reddish color 
and swollen nodes.  The alte rnate leaves have sheaths 
extending around the stems.   The seeds are black, 
shiny, flattened, and almost round.  There are 
approximately 62,000 seeds per pound. 
 
Adaptation and Distribution 
Pennsylvania smartweed is adapted to soils of all 
drainage classes except droughty soils.  It commonly 
occurs on mudflats of fresh water to moderately 
brackish areas through out the Northeast. 
 
Pennsylvania smartweed is distributed throughout the 
entire Unites States, excluding a few northwestern 
states.  For a current distribution map, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site. 
 
Establishment 
A seedbed that reduces most weed competition and 
permits smartweed to be covered by one inch of soil 
depth is usually sufficient.  Drop water quickly and 
broadcast seed on top of wet ground in mudflats or 
drawdown areas.  Seed after the last killing frost in 
the spring.  Smartweed may be seeded later so that 
seed maturity coincides with the arrival of migratory 
birds.  Seeds are generally broadcast at a rate of 10-
15 pounds per acre.

Management 
As an upland wildlife food source, plant either in 
pure stands or in mixtures with other suitable and 
adapted species.  For waterfowl food, draw down 
water where necessary shortly before planting.  Do 
not re-flood until plants are at least 6 inches in height.  
Flood the area to a depth of 12-18 inches during the 
migratory season.  Re-plant annually to assure a 
uniform stand.  A light harrowing is recommended to 
encourage natural re-establishment of stands. 
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and 
area of origin) 
No varieties exist, but common seed may be obtained 
through wildlife and game  food seed dealers.
