Description 
Cornus florida  L., flowering dogwood, is a small, 
bushy tree which rarely attains a height of more than 
40 feet or a diameter of 12 to 18 inches.  The leaves 
are opposite one another and from 3 to 6 inches long.  
The deeply ridged and broken bark resembles 
alligator hide.  Flowering  dogwood has large, showy, 
deeply notched bracts, 4  of which surround each 
cluster of inconspicuous perfect flowers, in bloom 
from May to June.  The fruit clusters on this shrub-
like tree are scarlet red. 
 
Adaptation and Distribution 
Flowering dogwood is adapted to most upland sites 
but grows best on rich, well-drained soils on middle 
and lower slopes.  It develops best as an understory 
species in association with other hardwoods. 
 
Flowering dogwood is distributed throughout the 
eastern United States.  For  a current distribution map, 
please consult the Plant Profile page for this species 
on the PLANTS Website. 
 
Establishment 
Plants can be grown from seed planted 1/2 inch deep 
in late winter. 
 
Management  
In tree harvest or timb er stand improvement 
operations, specify that 5 or 6 dogwoods per acre be 
left in the forest for aesthetic purposes and as a food 
source for squirrels, turkeys, deer, and non-game 
birds.  Leave all dogwoods along highways and 
roads. Robert H. Mohlenbrock  USDA NRCS 1995
