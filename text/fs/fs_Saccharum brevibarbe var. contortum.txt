Description 
Grass Family (Poaceae).  This plumegrass is a native, 
warm-season
, robust, perennial bunch grass.  The 
average height is 4  to 7 feet.  The leaf blade is wide 
and flat with strong midrib.  The leaf sheath has few 
hairs, especially at upper  end, and is shorter than 
internodes.  The stem is large and rigid and 3/8 to 1/2 
inches in diameter at base .  The nodes are smooth or 
covered with short white hairs.  Seedheads are open 
panicles, brownish at maturity with hairs as long as 
spikelets at its base.  The glume has an awn 3/8 to 1/2 
inched long spirally coiled at  the base of the spikelet.

Management 
This grass is easily overgrazed.  A season-long 
grazing deferment every 2 to 3 years maintains 
healthy, vigorous plants. 
 
Establishment 
New growth comes from auxillary buds at the basal 
nodes each year about April or May.  It also 
reproduces from seed.  It grows in large bunches 8 to 
10 inches in diameter and the seedheads appear in 
September and October.  It grows mostly on moist 
sandy to sandy loam soils high in natural fertility.
