Weed control and fertilization are important 
considerations for maximizing nut production.  
Fertility should be added according to a leaf analysis 
or you can use the rule of thumb of l pound of 
balanced fertilizer per l inch of trunk diameter. 
Fertilizer should be applied just prior to bud break.   
Pecan trees have a high requirement for zinc.  Zinc 
should be applied by foliar application at the 
beginning of bud break and every 14 days through 
early summer. 
 
Alternate Names

hickory, pecan nut, pecan tree 
 
Uses 
Nut production, wildlife habitat enhancement, 
esthetics, shade tree, wood and veneer production 
  Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status (e.g. threat
ened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description and Adaptation 
Pecan is a large tree to 150 feet with a broad rounded 
crown.  It is the largest of all the hickories.  It 
produces flowers  from March to May with both male 
and female flowers on the same tree.  Leaves are 
alternate, odd-pinnately compound with 9-17 leaflets.  
The fruit is a nut 1 to 2 inches long and ½ to l inch in 
diameter.  The nut is encased in a thin husk which is 
divided into sections which open in the fall at 
maturity.  The bark is grayish brown to light brown 
with flattened ridges and narrow fissures.  The wood 
is reddish brown with lighter sapwood, brittle and 
hard.  Pecan grows best in loam soils which are well 
drained without prolonged  flooding.  Pecan is 
adapted to areas with a mi nimum of 30 inches of 
average rainfall.  
     
Establishment 
Due to stratification requirements for the nut to 
sprout, establishment is best with nursery grown 
seedlings which are planted in the fall or early winter.  
In mass plantings bare root seedlings can be planted 
by hand or machine.  Care should be taken with root 
placement and planting depth.   The root collar should 
be planted at the same depth as grown in the nursery. 
  
Management  
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
Several insects need to be monitored.  Insects 
attacking the nut include;  pecan weevil, pecan nut 
casebearer, and hickory shuck worm.  Pecan scab 
disease is a potential problem.

Environmental Concerns 
None 
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and 
area of origin) 
Numerous cultivars are available for nut production, 
disease resistance, and adaptability.  The USDA 
Agricultural Research Service names their cultivars 
after Native American tribes.
