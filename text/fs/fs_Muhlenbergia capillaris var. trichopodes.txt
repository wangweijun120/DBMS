supplement with it.

Description 
Grass Family (Poaceae).  Cutover muhly is a native, 
warm-season, perennial bunch grass.  The height 
ranges from 1 to 3 feet.  Leaf  blade is 12 to 14 inches 
long; narrow; wiry, tough, twists slightly at maturity 
and margins fold or roll inward.  The leaf sheath is 
rounded, mostly basal and  curls into fibrous mass at 
maturity.  The ligule has a white, papery membrane 
1/8 to 1/4 inch long.  The seedhead is open and 
delicate with a purple panicle 14 to 20 inches long.  
The spikelets are 1/4 inch long, with short awns on 
glumes.

Management 
Generally this grass makes up a small part of the 
plant community.  Burning and grazing controls it.  It 
responds to proper grazing use and a grazing 
deferment of at least 60 days during growing season. 
 
Establishment 
This plant makes major growth from April through 
September.  A mixture of young, mature, and dead 
growth in a single clump is usual.  Little, if any, 
growth is made during cool season.  Summer growth, 
however, remains green during fall and winter.  Seed 
stalks are produced in late August and September and 
frequently persist through winter and early spring.  It 
is adapted to level to very gently sloping poorly 
drained strongly acid sands with fine-textured 
subsoil.
