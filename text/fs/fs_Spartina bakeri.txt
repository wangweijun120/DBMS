Grass Family (Poaceae).  Sand cordgrass is a 
warm-season, robust bunch grass, native to the U.S.  
The height ranges from 3 to  5 feet.  Leaf blade is flat 
and rolls inward when drying; 1/4 inch wide; upper 
surface is dark green, lower light green and coarse 
ridges on upper  surface.  Leaf sheath is rounded.  
Seedhead has 5 to 12 spikes, each 1-1/4 to 2-1/2 
inches long, lying close to stem; spikelets grow on 
one side of rachis and seedhead 2 to 8 inches long. 
 
Management 
This grass increases on ranges that are grazed 
continuously. 
 
Establishment 
Makes its major growth during spring.  Seeds form 
during late May and June in most ranges, later in the 
northern parts.  Vegetative growth continues until  fall.  Some basal leaves remain green during winter 
in south Florida.  Mature plants often form bunches 
18 to 20 inches in diameter.  Adapted to margins of 
sand ponds and fresh marshes throughout range.
