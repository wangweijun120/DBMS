TEXAS CUPGRASS 
Eriochloa sericea (Scheele) 
Munro ex Vasey  
Plant Symbol = ERSE5

Uses 
Texas cupgrass is a highly palatable forage grass.  It 
is readily eaten year round  by all classes of livestock. 
It can be used as a component in native range 
restoration projects. 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status (e.g. threat ened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description 
Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea ) is a tufted, warm-
season, perennial grass that  grows 3 to 3 ½ feet in 
height.  This erect grass is a member of the  Paniceae 
tribe of grasses.  Ther e is no known commercial 
variety of Texas cupgrass. 
 
Adaptation 
Texas cupgrass is found in Oklahoma, Texas, and 
Northern Mexico.  In Texas, it can be found in North 
Central Texas, the eastern portion of the Rolling 
Plains, south to the eastern part of the Edwards 
Plateau and the the Rio Grande Plains, and rarely on 
a few sites in East Texas.   It prefers clay and clay 
loam soils.  Texas cupgrass grows mostly on well-
drained prairies, and brushy, rocky slopes with tight 
loamy soils.

Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS 
Website. 
 
Establishment 
Texas cupgrass can be grown from seed.  A 1990 
germination test conducted by the Kika de la Garza 
Plant Material Center staff yielded 50 percent 
germination.  A second germination test conducted in 
the summer of 2000, yielded approximately 40% 
germination after only 14 days at 20 °C for 12 hours 
of darkness and 30ºC for 12 hours of light. 
 
Management  
Texas cupgrass survives only under moderate grazing 
pressure.  It will persist in overgrazed pastures only 
under the protection of shrubs.  Texas cupgrass is an 
indicator of good range condition. It is seldom a key 
management species, however, because it rarely 
dominates a site.  
 
Texas cupgrass has several problems from a seed 
production standpoint.  First of all, some of the taller 
plants tend to lodge, which makes harvesting seed a 
problem.  Second, seed retention is poor.  Seed 
shatter tends to occur fairly rapidly after the seed has 
ripened making it difficult to harvest a stand because 
all the heads do not ripen at once. Third, there 
appears to be an ongoing problem with spittlebugs on 
the seed heads, which decreases the quantity of viable 
seed.  Finally, Texas cupgrass appears to be 
susceptible to smut on the seed heads, a problem that 
can also affect seed quality. 
 
In an attempt to increase seed retention, a study was 
conducted at the Kika de la Garza PMC in the spring 
of 2000 with Texas cupgrass.  Treatments of 
Spodnam, a chemical used to  increase seed retention, 
were tried with no success.  The plants treated with

Spodnam and the untreated plants showed no 
significant difference in seed retention.
