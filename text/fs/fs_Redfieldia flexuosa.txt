Management 
This grass is managed primarily as a wind-erosion 
control plant.  It may be grazed lightly by cattle and 
horses during the dormant season. 
 
Establishment 
Growth starts in spring when the average daily 
temperature is 60' to 65' F.  Most leaves are basal.  It 
reproduces from long, slender rhizomes grow in the 
upper few inches of soil.  It is found growing in 
colonies on deep sandy to  very sandy soils that are 
subject to blowing, plus on sand deposits several 
inches deep.
