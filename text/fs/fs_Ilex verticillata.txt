COMMON 
WINTERBERRY  
Ilex verticillata (L.) Gray 
Plant Symbol = ILVE  
 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS Plant Materials 
Program 
 
Warning:  Although this shrub species is a good 
provider of wildlife food, its fruits are poisonous 
to humans. 
 
Uses 
The attractive bright red fruit of winterberry is eaten 
by small mammals and more than 48 species of birds.  
The leaves and stems of winterberry are not a 
preferred source of brow se, but moose, whitetail 
deer, cottontail rabbits, and snowshoe hare do utilize 
this plant.  The persistent bright red fruit of this shrub 
make it very popular for landscaping.  It is 
recommended for planting in shady moist areas, even 
though its growth and form are best under open 
grown conditions. 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plantâ€™s 
current status (e.g. threat ened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description 
Winterberry is an erect moderate sized shrub, 
growing to heights of 5 to 15 feet tall.  The smooth 
bark of winterberry is gray to blackish, with knobby 
lenticels  The dense branches of this shrub grow in a 
zigzag pattern with an upri ght spreading crown.  The 
twigs are slender, with gray  to gray-brown color and 
small buds. 
 
The simple, smooth, obovate to oblong-ovate foliage 
is sharply double toothed, with medium fine texture.  
The deciduous leaves are  arranged alternately along 
the stems.  Each leaf is 1 1/2 to 4 inches long, with 
dark green summer color turning yellow in fall, then 
drop off by mid-October. 
 
Small, inconspicuous, axillary, greenish to yellowish-
white flowers bloom from April to July, after leaves 
have emerged. Like most others in the holly genus, 
winterberry is dioecious.   Three years after planting, 
pistillate flowers begin to emerge in small clusters 
plants and staminate flowers develop on male plants 
with up to twelve flowers in a cluster; only now can 
plant gender be determined. Scarlet red to orange, 
globular fruit mature by late summer, often 
remaining on the plant into mid-winter.  The berry-
like fruit is about 1/4 inch in diameter, occurring 
singlely or in pairs, each containing 3 to 5 small 
nutlets.  There are an average of 92,000 seeds per 
pound.

Adaptation and Distribution 
Winterberry is found throughout the eastern United 
States. For a current distribution map, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Website. 
 
Establishment 
Planting units of winterberry are propagated by seed, 
rooted stem divisions, and stem cuttings alike.  The 
germination is usually hindered by hard seed coats 
and embryo dormancy.  Utilizing proper after 
ripening and cold moist stratification procedures, 
germination can be stimulated.  Seed should be 
covered with at least 1/8 to 1/2 inch of soil on nursery 
beds.  Fall seedings should be mulched for winter 
protection. 
 
When seedlings are acquired , the sex of the plant is 
typically indeterminable, in contrast to those 
propagated vegetatively.  In late fall root suckers can 
be directly dug and transplanted, while actively

growing softwood cuttings are taken from late spring 
to mid-summer.  The cuttings are first placed under 
glass or plastic, but once roots form and begin to 
grow, they can be transplanted into containers or 
nursery beds for further development. 
 
Utilize standard tree and shrub planting procedures to 
plant bare rooted transplants, containerized, or balled 
and burlapped stock. 
 
Management 
It is important to plant both male and females within 
40 feet of one another for adequate pollination.  For 
wildlife plantings, it is advantageous to plant higher 
numbers of females.  Weed control by mowing or 
chemical application is necessary to keep competing 
vegetation from over-topping winterberries. 
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and 
area of origin) 
There are a number of ornamental varieties, selected 
for berry and leaf color, available from commercial 
nurseries. Local and regionally collected materials 
are available from native plant nurseries.
