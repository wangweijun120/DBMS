Alternate names:   Some taxonomic treatments 
include mountain brome ( Bromus marginatus), 
( Bromus carinatus  var. marginatus ) and others.  
Consult the Flora of North America, Volume 24 
(2007) and Intermountain Flora, Volume 6 (1977).  
 
Uses:  California brome is a medium-tall, 
competitive, native bunchgrass valued for its rapid 
and easy establishment in revegetation and erosion 
control.  It is also widely  used for rehabilitation after 
wildfires and mining, rangeland improvement, and 
restoration of upland plant communities.  This 
species is considered to be a moderately to highly 
productive, nutritious, and palatable forage relished 
by all classes of livestock prior to maturity.  In some 
ranges it is important summer forage for elk, but 
considered less palatable to deer.  Bear, geese, and  various rodents also consume the foliage.  The deep 
fibrous root system makes th
e plant fairly resistant to 
grazing and drought.  While a good range grass, use
alone it may not be suitable for permanent pasture 
because of its short longevity .  One of the better uses 
of California brome may be as a native competitor to 
aid in the reduction of exotic  weeds a year or two in 
advance of planting other native grasses.  California 
brome provides good cover for wildlife and the seed 
is consumed by small mammals and game bird

Description:  California brome is a native, cool-
season, annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial 
bunchgrass.  It is a highly variable species.  The base 
of this robust plant is very open with coarse, erect to
spreading stems (culms) that grow 45-120 cm tall. 
Leaf blades are 1-12 mm wide, lax and spread out 
along stems.  The infloresce nce (seed head , panicle) 
is 10-30 cm long, large, open, and erect to somewhat

Key to identification : California brome intergrades 
with mountain brome  and some authors classify b
as the same species.  Other species are also very 
difficult to distinguish from California brome so a 
current taxonomic key should be consulted.  Sitka 
brome (Bromus sitchensis ) is a good example and
their natural habitats overlap considerably.  Both 
occur in full sun, but Sitk a brome can also be found
in somewhat shadier envi ronments.  According to 
some taxonomists, Sitka brome is taller with broader, 
more drooping panicles and spikelets (subunits o
seedhead) that occur more  toward the tip of the 
branchlets compared to California brome.  Pacific 
brome (Bromus pacificus) can also be confused with 
both bromes, but its leaves are soft hairy (on at leas
one side) and it has other distinguishing features.  
Pacific brome occurs mainly along the Pacific Co
in moist habitats but extends inland to the Pug
tr
 
Adaptation:  California brome is widely distributed 
in western North America from British Columbia and 
Alberta south to California and Mexico and eastward 
to Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico.
It occurs in open areas including meadows, coastal 
prairies, montane slopes, and waste places as w
open woodlands, oak savanna, sagebrush, and 
chaparral from sea level to  11,000 ft in elevation.  
The species is adapted to moderately moist to dr
soils with a pH of 5.5 to 8.0.  While tolerant of 
somewhat poor drainage and fine textured clays, best 
growth is attained on medium-textured or loamy soils

with good drainage. It is found in environments with
full sun to slight shade.  The species withstands fall 
fires and controlled burns and will sprout from 
surviving crowns. In other cases, stands may top

Limitations or environmental concerns:   Cal
brome spreads easily by seed and can quickly 
become a moderate to serious weed pest in cert
agricultural crops.  Its use should generally be 
avoided in certain areas of intensive agriculture such 
as fields of introduced grasses grown for seed. Seed 
may remain viable in the soil for several years.  Hig
seeding rates in mixes with other less competitive 
native grasses should be avoided.  California brome 
is susceptible to a disease called head smut.  Wild 
stands or fields to be harvested for seed should be 
inspected carefully for the di sease and infected p
avoided or removed. Smut can be controlled by  tr
sowing.  Leaf and stem rusts are other potential pests. 
 
Establishment:
  Seed dormancy is usually absent in 
natural populations from low elevation so California 
brome can be fall or spring sown.  Germination 
occurs in 10-14 days and seedling growth and plan
development are rapid.  However, seed obtained fr
higher elevation populations may have dorm
requiring 30-90 days of cold moist stratification 
(moist pre-chilling) or fall sowing for best 
germination.  Physical conditioning of the seed to 
remove the awns (narrow appendage at the tip of the
seed) is an option to improve flow through seeding
equipment.  There are 60, 000-82,000 seeds/lb with 
the upper range associated with de-awned seed. 
Therefore, each pound of seed planted per acre will 
result in about 1.5-2.0 seeds/sq. ft.  When sown 
alone, the suggested rate is 8-10 lbs of pure live see
