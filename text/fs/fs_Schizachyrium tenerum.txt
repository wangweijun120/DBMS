SLENDER LITTLE BLUESTEM  
Schizachyrium tenerum Nees  
Plant Symbol = SCTE5 
 
Contributed By: USDA NRCS National Plant Data 
Center 
 Alternate Names 
slender bluestem, Andropogon tener 
 
Uses 
Although slender little bluestem is not one of the 
preferred forage grasses in the southern U.S., cattle 
graze it when it is young and tender.   
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plantâ€™s 
current status, such as, state noxious status, and 
wetland indicator values. 
 
Description 
Grass Family (Poaceae).  Slender little bluestem is a 
native, warm-season, perennial bunch grass.  The 
height is between 1 and 3 feet, often found reclining 
or lying flat on ground.  The leaf blade is narrow; 2 to 
8 inches long; 1/16 inch wide or less; wiry.  The leaf 
sheath is rounded; smooth; mostly basal.  The ligule 
is hairy.  The stem is a bend at each node giving a 
zigzag appearance; often br anching at nodes.  The 
seedhead is single straight spike-like raceme on each 
seed stalk.  The seeds sh atter soon after maturity, 
leaving a tiny hollow tip on each stalk. 
 
Distribution : For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site. 
 
Management 
Grazing practices should  favor the broader leafed, 
more palatable grasses rather than slender bluestem.  
Heavy grazing for a short pe riod after spring growth 
starts followed by a 6-month grazing deferment and 
light use make it possible for later maturing grasses, 
such as pinehill bluestem ( Schizachyrium scoparium 
var.  divergens ) to shade out slender bluestem and 
dominate the site.  Slender bluestem increases if 
burned annually and grazed continuously.  New 
growth following a burn is the most palatable.  As 
seed stalks form, palatability declines rapidly.  It is an 
indicator of excessive grazing. 
 
Establishment 
Growth starts in the early spring and continues into 
the summer.  The seedheads generally form by 
mid-July.  In the fall and winter, foliage tangles, mats 
together, and turns a faded straw color.  This species 
grows in colonies.  Slender bluestem is not as shade 
tolerant as many associated grasses.  It is best 
adapted to open or sparsely wooded poorly drained 
soils and is also found on sandy well-drained soils.
