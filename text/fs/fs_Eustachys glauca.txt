Description 
Grass Family (Poaceae).  Saltmarsh fingergrass is a 
native, warm-season, perennial bunch grass.  The 
height ranges from 3 to 4 feet.  The leaf blade is 
folded 12 to 14 inches long, rounded at tip and dark 
green.  The leaf sheath is crowded at the base, keeled, 
overlapping, and merges into the blade without a 
distinct collar.  The ligule is a minute fringe of hairs.   
The seedhead has 15 to 20 spikes, each 4 to 5 inches 
long and the spikelets are br own, all on one side of 
rachis.

Management 
Continuous close grazing easily kills this grass.  For 
maximum production and spre ad, graze it properly at 
all times and defer grazing every 2 to 3 years for at 
least 90 days throughout the growing season. 
 
Establishment 
Growth starts early in the spring and continues 
through the summer.  It makes good regrowth.  
Growing points are 3 to 4 inches above ground early 
in the season.  It produces  seed two to three times 
during a long growing season.  In southern Florida, 
parts of the plant stay green all year.  It is adapted to 
coastal flatwoods, swamp margins, and sloughs on 
calcareous soils, thous it grows best in brackish 
marshes.
