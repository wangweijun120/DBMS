SAWTOOTH OAK 
Quercus acutissima 
Carruthers 
Plant Symbol = QUAC80 
 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS Northeast Plant 
Materials Program 
 
 
Uses 
The primary use for this species is as a wildlife food 
source and cover. It is also a good shade tree. 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plant’s 
current status (e.g. threat ened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description 
Sawtooth oak is a large species, reaching a mature 
height of 70 feet.  The leaves are similar to those of 
the chestnut but are smaller, 4-8 inches, and have 
pointed teeth.  The acorns are also small in size, 
ranging from 5/8-3/4 inch long and are enclosed in 
cups with long, spreading, recurving scales.  
Approximately 2/3 of the nut is covered by the cup.  
Trees produce about 150 acorns per pound. 
 
Adaptation and Distribution 
Sawtooth oak is native to eastern Asia but was 
introduced into the eastern United States around 
1920.  The range of adaptation extends from 
Northern Florida west to eastern Texas and 
Oklahoma, northward through Missouri to New York  and into southern New England.  On exposed sites in 
the northern Finger Lakes Region of New York, it 
may winterkill.  Sawtooth oak is winter hardy and 
can be grown in soils from sandy loam to clay loam.  
However, the best perform
ance is achieved in deep, 
well-drained soils.  It can also be grown on reclaimed 
surface mined land where favorable moisture 
conditions are present and pH is above 5.0.

Establishment 
One year old seedlings shou ld be planted 15-20 feet 
apart for maximum acorn pro duction.  In areas where 
multiple rows are used, the spacing should be no less 
than 20 feet apart.  There sh ould be at least 15 plants 
per planting for effective wind pollination.  Site 
preparation consists of clearing the existing 
vegetation from an area at least 3 feet in diameter 
around the newly planted seedling.  The seedling 
should be planted at the same depth it was growing at 
in the nursery.  At the bottom of the hole, apply a 
handful of 10-10-10 or 18-8-3 fertilizer pellets.  
Cover the pellets with 2-3 inches of soil.  Do not 
allow the seedling to come in contact with the 
fertilizer.  Water and mulch immediately to conserve 
water and discourage weeds. 
 
If planting by acorns, begin in the early fall.  Plant 
acorns 3/4-1 inch deep.  Th e seedlings should not be 
transplanted until they reach  12-18 inches in height. 
 
Management 
To achieve desired results, keep competition to a 
minimum for 2 years.  By this time, the seedlings 
should be well established.  If growth is stunted, 
eliminate competition and apply a complete fertilizer. 
 
Sawtooth oak seedlings do not do well in poorly 
drained soils or in areas subject to flooding.  If under 
water for 24 hours in the summer, they will not 
survive.  
 
This plant has been found to be resistant to disease 
and insect damage. 
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and 
area of origin) 
‘Gobbler’ was released in  1986 by the Quicksand 
Plant Materials Center in cooperation with the

Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station, Kentucky 
Department of Fish & Wildlife, and the Kentucky 
Division of Forestry.  It was selected for resistance to 
insects and disease, wildlif e food value, and growth 
form compared to similar use species.  Plant 
materials are available fro m nurseries throughout the 
region.
