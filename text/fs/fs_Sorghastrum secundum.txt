Description 
Grass Family (Poaceae).  Lopsided Indiangrass is a 
warm-season, perennial bunch grass.  The height 
ranges from 3 to 6 feet.  The leaf blade is flat; 1/4 to 
1/2 inch wide and 12 to 24 inches long.  The leaf 
sheath is rounded and the ligule has a membrane 1/4 
to 1/2 inches long and pointed.  The seedhead has a 
narrow golden brown one-sided panicle giving it the 
name lopsided Indiangrass. 
 
Management 
On ranges in good condition, this grass contributes as 
much as 15 percent of total production.  To increase 
it on ranges in poor and fair condition, complete 
growing-season grazing deferments every 2 to 3 
years are required. 
 
Establishment 
It is adapted to well-drained soils.  It does not grow 
on poorly drained sites or on sites subject to standing 
water.
