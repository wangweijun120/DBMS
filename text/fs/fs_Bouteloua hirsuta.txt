HAIRY GRAMA 
Bouteloua hirsuta Lag. 
Plant Symbol = BOHI2  
 
Contributed By: USDA NRCS National Plant Data 
Center 
 
 
Uses  
Hairy grama is used primarily for grazing and 
withstands it well.  Most  livestock graze it readily 
any season.  It makes especi ally good winter forage, 
because it cures well.  It is not considered a hay 
grass. 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plantâ€™s 
current status, such as, state noxious status and 
wetland indicator values. 
 
Description 
Grass Family (Poaceae).  Hairy grama is a native, 
warm-season, perennial grass.  The height is between  10 and 20 inches.  The leaf blade is flat or slightly 
rolled; narrow; mostly basal; margins hairy.  The leaf 
sheath is rounded; smooth; shorter than internodes.  
The seedhead is 1 to 4 spikes, purplish before 
maturity, about 1 inch long; rachis extends beyond 
spikelets. 
 
Distribution
: For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site. 
 
Management 
This grass yields more if it is not overgrazed and 
grazing is deferred every 2 to 3 years during the 
period of most active growth. 
 
Establishment 
Hairy grama makes little growth before summer rains 
begin.  If moisture is adequate, it matures rapidly.  
During exceptionally dry y ears, produces little forage 
but withstands drought well.  It reproduces from 
auxiliary buds at basal nodes, from short stolons in 
some localities, and from seed.  In the northern part 
of its range, this grass usually has only 1 or 2 spikes 
per seedhead and short stolons that form a sod.  
Further south, it grows taller, more like a bunch 
grass, and has 2 to 4 spikes per seedhead.  A tall 
variety ( B. hirsuta  var. pectinata)  grows mostly in 
central Texas.  It is adapted to sandy and sandy loam 
soils and gravelly loams and does well on soils 
neutral to slightly calcareous .  It is often associated 
with blue grama ( Bouteloua gracilis ), but is more 
drought resistant.
