cool-season, rhizomatous perennial.  The height 
ranges from 10 to 20 inches .  The leaf blade is mostly  basal, long, narrow, and boat shaped at the end.  The

Management 
 From Britton & Brown (1913) @ plants.usda.gov 
Grazing should be deferred in spring every few years 
to allow this grass to produce  a seed crop.  It is a key 
management species on some sites that are winter 
grazed by cattle and sheep.  If it is, no more than 50 
percent of current year's growth by weight should be 
removed by grazing. 
 
Establishment 
Growth begins in the fall.  Foliage stays green all 
winter, if moisture is available.  It becomes dormant 
through the hot summer months.  In extremely low 
temperatures, leaves freeze but more leaves grow 
from auxiliary buds on the basal nodes.  It reproduces 
from stolons and from seed.  Seeds produced in the 
spring germinate in the fall.  It grows best on clay 
and clay loam soils.
