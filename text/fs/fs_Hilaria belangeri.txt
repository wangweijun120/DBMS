Description 
Grass Family (Poaceae).  Curly-mesquite is a native, 
warm-season stoloniferous perennial grass.  The 
height range is from 4 to 10  inches.  The leaf blade is 
flat, curly, and usually short.  The leaf sheath is 
shorter than the internodes and mostly basal.  The 
stem is erect and the plan t is stoloniferous.  The 
seedhead is a solitary spike usually 3/4 to 1 inches 
long. 
 
Distribution : For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site.

Management 
For maximum production, this grass requires proper 
grazing use and periodic grazing deferments of 30  to 
40 days all year. 
 
Establishment 
Growth starts in late the spring and the seedheads 
will start emerging 30  to 40  days later.  It reproduces 
primarily from stolons.  Some stolons are aerial and 
produce leaves and no roots.  Others creep along the 
ground and produce both leaves and roots at the 
nodes, which usually have a ring of hairs.  It grows 
mostly in pure stands, but sometimes grows in 
clusters from auxiliary buds on the basal nodes.  It 
does not tolerate shade.  The plant is pale green and 
not a vigorous competitor.  It grows on a wide variety 
of soils, though it grows best on loams to clay loams 
that have a pH of 6.8 to 7.4.
