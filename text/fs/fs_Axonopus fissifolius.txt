parking lots, baseball fields, and picnic areas.

Description 
Grass Family (Poaceae).  Common carpetgrass is a 
native, warm-season, stoloniferous perennial grass.  
The height is between 8 and 20 inches.  The leaf 
blade is usually flat or folded; 1/4 to 1/2 inch wide; 
fine hair along margin near base; rounded or slightly 
pointed; and reddish or purplish near maturity.  The 
ligule is a minute membrane.  The seedhead is 
usually 3 slender racemes 1-1/2 to 4 inches long, 2 at 
summit and 1, rarely 2, below. 
 
Distribution : For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site. 
 
Management 
For maximum production and most efficient harvest 
by livestock, grazing should be rotated about every 
30 to 40 days and no more than 50 percent of current 
year's growth by weight grazed off.  A 2- to 3-inch 
stubble height is a good gage of proper use.  
Fertilization is not profitable on all sites. 
 
Establishment 
In southern Florida, common carpetgrass stays green 
all year.  Elsewhere, it becomes dormant early in the 
fall and starts growth in the spring.  It produces 
seedheads and stolons du ring the active growth 
period.  It reproduces from stolons and from seed.  
Pure stands are common.  It is adapted to clays, 
sands, mucks, and peats.  Most commonly, it is found 
on slightly acid sandy to sandy loam soils that have a 
favorable soil-moisture relationship.
