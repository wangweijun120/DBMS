Description 
Grass Family (Poaceae).  Cylinder jointtail grass is a 
native, warm-season, rhizomatous perennial grass.  
The height is between 1 and 3-1/2 feet.  The leaf 
blade is slender; pointed, 8 to 14 inches long, flat at 
first, then rolled inward at maturity.  The basal blades 
are shorter than those higher on the stem.  The leaf 
sheath is rounded, about as long as the internodes.  
The stem is erect with sw
ollen, purplish node.  The 
seedhead is a raceme, cy lindric, slightly curved; 
seedhead 2 to 6 inches long.  The spikelets are 
sessile, awnless, and in pairs at the nodes of a 
thickened rachis. 
 
Distribution : For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site. 
 
Management 
This grass is never abundant enough to be a key 
management species.  Proper use and management of 
associated grasses maintain it in the plant 
community. 
 
Establishment 
Cylinder jointtail grass growth starts in early spring.  
It produces seedheads in May and June and seeds 
disseminate in early summer .  It becomes dormant in 
the fall.  It reproduces from short, bulb-shaped 
rhizomes.  It does not grow in pure stands, but is 
scattered throughout a plant community and grows 
best on well-drained soils.
