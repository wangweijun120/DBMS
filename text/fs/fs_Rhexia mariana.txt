Uses 
This plant is used mainly for landscape 
beautification.  It has potential for use in cultivated, 
garden situations, in natu ralized prairie or meadow 
plantings, and along roadsides. 
 
Status 
Several states consider th is species threatened or 
endangered.  Please consult the PLANTS Web site 
and your State Department of Natural Resources for 
this plantâ€™s current stat us (e.g. threatened or 
endangered species, state noxious status, and wetland 
indicator values). 
 
Description 
Melastomataceae Family: An upright (up to 2.5 feet), 
hairy perennial that frequently spreads to form large 
colonies.  It is native to the U.S.  The opposite leaves 
are elongated, three-nerved,  with toothed margins.  
The pink to lavender or occasionally white flowers 
are produced from May to October in small clusters 
near the top of the plant.  Ea ch flower is 1-2 inches in 
diameter and contains 4 petals; the yellow to orange 
anthers in the center are elongated and curved  downwards.  The tiny tan to brownish seeds are held 
in a reddish urn-shaped capsule. 
 
Adaptation and Distribution 
Meadow beauty grows best in a sunny exposure.  It is 
adapted to heavy textured and to highly organic soils.  
Natural stands are usually found on moist to wet sites 
such as in ditches, marshes, and wet meadows. 
 
Maryland meadow beauty is distributed primarily 
throughout the East and lower Midwest.  For a 
current distribution map, please consult the Plant 
Profile page for this species on the PLANTS 
Website. 
 
Establishment 
A clean, firm seedbed is essential.  The site should be 
treated with a herbicide to control vegetation, tilled, 
culti-packed once or twice, and allowed to settle 
thoroughly before sowing. 
 
Broadcast 0.5-1 gram seed per 100 square feet (0.5-1 
lb/acre).  The seed can be mixed with sand or rice 
hulls to increase volume so that it will be easier to 
spread uniformly over the planting site.  The seed 
must remain on the soil surface because it is easily 
smothered when buried in the soil.  Heavy rains after 
planting may cause the seed to be buried or washed 
from the site.

Management  
Apply fertilizer according to soil test 
recommendations.  If not available, a rate of 3.5-5.5 
oz per 100 square feet (100-150 lb/acre) of 13-13-13 
should be applied after the seedlings are established 
and annually thereafter.  If  necessary, stands can be 
mowed in the spring before stem elongation begins.  
Later mowings should be delayed until the plants 
have set seed.
