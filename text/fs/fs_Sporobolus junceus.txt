Description 
Grass Family (Poaceae).  Pineywoods dropseed is a 
native, warm-season, perennial bunch grass.  The 
height ranges from 2 to 3 feet.  The leaf blade is 
primarily basal, less than 1/6 inch wide, and 8 to 15 
inches long with a distinc tive blue green color.  A 
few hairs occur at the base and the upper blade rolls 
inward, resembling a long pine needle.  The leaf  sheath is rounded and longer than the internodes.  
The seedhead has an open panicle that is bronze to 
purple in color and 4 to 6 inches long with branches 
in regular whorls around the stem.  1 to 3 seed stalks 
are produced from each bunch. 
 
Distribution
: For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site. 
Management 
Studies in central Louisiana show that this grass 
makes up only one percent of plant composition and 
provides only 3 to 5 percent of the livestock diet on 
well-managed ranges.  It increases, however, when 
more palatable associated gr asses are grazed out.  An 
abundance of this grass indicates a deteriorating 
range.  It is not easily damaged by fire.

Establishment 
It grows during the late winter and spring.  
Vegetative growth is generally completed when the 
seedheads appear in late  April and May.  It grows 
mostly in shaded areas and is adapted to fairly well-
drained sandy loam soils.  It seldom grows on wet or 
flooded sites.
