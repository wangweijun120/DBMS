PRAIRIE 
CORDGRASS 
Spartina pectinata  Bosc ex 
Link 
Plant Symbol = SPPE  
 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS Rose Lake Plant 
Materials Center 
 
Uses 
Erosion Control: Prairie cordgrass has a stiff stem 
and vigorous rhizomes that enable it to provide good 
shoreline cover, and contribute to wave energy 
dissipation.  It has proven useful in preventing 
erosion on earthfill dams, spillways and drainage 
channels.  
 
Restoration: This species could be used to restore or 
reconstruct wetlands where prolonged flooding does 
not occur. 
 
Wildlife : Prairie cordgrass forms thick stands around 
marshes, providing good cover for game birds, song 
birds and small mammals.  
 
Ethnobotanic : Native Americans and pioneers used 
prairie cordgrass for thatching lodges. 
 
This grass is not a forage resource. 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plantâ€™s 
current status (e.g. threat ened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description 
Prairie cordgrass is a tall  (6-8 feet), robust, native 
grass.  Strong rhizomes with the ability to grow 5-10 
feet per year separate this grass from the other 
desirable native warm season grasses. An easy 
characteristic to look for is  the sharp, serrated edges 
of the leaf blade.  Seedheads are composed of 10 to 
20 spikes attached to the main stem.  Each spike has 
up to 40 spikelets, all growing in two rows on the 
side of the spike away from the stem.  The seed 
typically matures within a week or two of frost, and 
is flat, paper-like with barbed  awns that attach firmly 
to fur or fabric.  There are 197,000 seeds per pound. 
 
Adaptation and Distribution 
Prairie cordgrass grows throughout the Northeast, 
Great Lakes and Midwest states as well as most other 
states in the country.  It is typically found on lower, 
poorly drained soils along roadsides, ditches, streams, 
marshes and potholes.  It also occurs in floodplains, 
wet meadows and back dune areas.  Prairie cordgrass 
grows well on seasonally dry sites, tolerates alkaline 
conditions and high water tables but is intolerant of 
prolonged flooding.  Seedlings are not shade tolerant.  
The rapid seedling development of this species 
enables it to avoid frost-heaving problems on wetter 
soils.

Establishment 
Prairie cordgrass should be seeded as early in the 
spring as possible. It should be planted with other 
warm season grasses to add variety to the cover. 
Native grass drills such as the Truax, Great Plains, or 
Tye are the best units for planting this seed as they 
have positive feed mechanisms for chaffy seed and 
double disk furrow opener s. If a suitable drill is not

available or cannot be used due to terrain, then 
broadcasting the seed and tracking it in with a 
bulldozer is also an excellent planting method. 
Mulches are avoided with warm season grass 
plantings unless absolutely necessary to control 
erosion--then use 1500 pounds per acre of straw as a 
maximum rate. 
 
No nitrogen fertilizer should be applied during the 
seeding year. Phosphorus and potassium should be at 
medium levels, and the pH should be 6.0 or better. 
 
Management 
Prairie cordgrass has few management needs except 
to avoid mowing. Cutting this grass more than once 
per season will reduce its vigor.
