COMMON REED 
Phragmites australis  (Cav.) 
Trin. ex Steud.  
Plant Symbol = PHAU7  
 
Contributed By: USDA NRCS National Plant Data 
Center
 Considered a noxious weed in several states. 
 
Alternate Names 
giant reed, giant reedgrass, Roseau, roseau cane, 
yellow cane, cane, Phragmites communis  
 
Uses  
Although coarse, common reed  is readily eaten by 
cattle and horses.  It provides high quality 
warm-season forage but becomes tough and 
unpalatable after maturity.  Animals grazing this 
grass during winter should be fed a protein 
concentrate.  This plant has been used in the 
Southwest for lattices in constructing adobe houses.   Indians have used the stems for arrows, weaving 
mats, and carrying nets. 
 
Status 
Considered a noxious weed 
in several states.  Please 
consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plantâ€™s 
current status, such as, state noxious status and 
wetland indicator values. 
 
Description 
Grass Family (Poaceae).  Common reed is a 
warm-season, rhizomatous, stoloniferous perennial, 
native to the U.S.  The height ranges from 6 to 12 
feet.  The leaf blade is flat; smooth; 1/2 to 2 inches 
wide; and 6 to 18 inches long.  The seedhead is an 
open panicle with a purplish or tawny and flaglike 
appearance after seed shatter.  Common reed is 
readily identified by its height.  It is the tallest grass 
in southern marshes and swamps. 
 
Management 
This grass cannot withstand prolonged heavy grazing.  
Its upright growth makes it easy for livestock to 
remove all the leaves.  For maximum production, no 
more than 50 percent of  current year's growth by 
weight should be grazed off during growing season.  
Common reed tolerates burning if water is above soil 
surface.  Burning is not essential for management.  
Water control that lowers the water level, but does 
not drain the area, increases production.  Grazing 
deferments of 60 to 90 days every 2 to 3 years during 
the growing season improve plant vigor. 
 
Establishment 
Growth starts in February in some locations.  Foliage 
stays green until frost.  New shoots grow from buds 
at nodes of old, stems, stolons, and rhizomes.  It 
grows in marshes and swamps, on banks of streams 
and lakes, and around springs.  It grows best in firm 
mineral clays and tolerates moderate salinity.  It does 
best if water level fluctuates from 6 inches below soil 
surface to 6 inches above.  Common reed is often 
codominant with big cordgrass (Spartina 
cynosuroides)  on the gulf coast marsh rangelands.
