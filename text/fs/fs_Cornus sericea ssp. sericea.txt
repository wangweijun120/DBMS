REDOSIER 
DOGWOOD  
Cornus sericea  L. ssp. sericea 
Plant Symbol = COSES  
 
Contributed by: USDA NRCS Plant Materials 
Program 
 
Alternate Names 
Cornus stolonifera Michx. 
 
Uses 
The primary use of this sp ecies is for streambank 
protection.  It can be planted alone or with other 
species, such as willows.  Other beneficial uses are 
for fish and wildlife habitat improvement, 
windbreaks, slope stabilization, borders, and as an 
ornamental. 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plantâ€™s 
current status (e.g. threat ened or endangered species, 
state noxious status, and wetland indicator values). 
 
Description 
Redosier dogwood is a large shrub, often 6-9 feet in 
height.  The growth habit is upright rounded, but 
where stems are in contact  with the ground, roots are 
formed.  This behavior creates thickets.  This 
dogwood has bright red stems in the fall, winter and 
early spring, which turn greenish in the summer.  It  also has white pith, dark green ovate leaves, white 
flowers, and whitish colored 
fruit.  There are 18,500 
seeds per pound. 
 
Adaptation and Distribution 
Redosier dogwood is adapted from Ohio to Maine 
and south to northern Virginia and New Jersey.  It 
performs best in soils that are moist, somewhat 
poorly drained, moderately acidic to neutral, and in 
areas that have medium to coarse soils.  It is tolerant 
of some shade but not of droughty conditions.

Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS 
Website. 
 
Establishment 
Streambanks that have steep slopes must first be 
graded.  The slope should be 1:1 or flatter.  Any trees 
considered unstable should  be removed.  One year 
old rooted cuttings should be used for planting.  Plant 
in early spring, preferably  before May.  Do not plant 
after June 1.  Plant the cuttings two feet apart for 
streambank erosion control, four to six feet apart for 
wildlife habitat.  Establishment with other species, 
such as willow and other riparian species, is a good 
practice.  On sites with  banks that may become dry 
over the summer, utilize redosier dogwood next to 
the water, with willows ab ove.  Immediately after 
planting, grasses and legumes may be planted to 
provide initial stabilization.  After 2 or 3 years the 
dogwoods will become effec tive.  The cultivar 'Ruby' 
is vulnerable to livestock browsing.  In order to 
ensure survival, fencing must be incorporated into the 
plan.

Redosier dogwood can also be mixed with willows in 
soil bioengineering methods.  Stems can be used in 
live fascines, brush layering and brush mattressing. 
 
Rooted hardwood cuttings are taken in January, 
allowed to develop callus in refrigerated storage, and 
planted in mid-May in well drained soil 2 inches 
apart.  The cuttings should be 1/4-1/2 inch in 
diameter and 9 to 12 inches long.  They should be 
planted with about 2 inches exposed above ground 
level.  Rooting hormone is recommended to enhance 
success in the nursery. 
 
Management  
Erosion is a continuous process and, because of this, 
careful management is required at these streambank

plantings.  The areas should be examined each spring 
after the major runoff period has ended.  Areas where 
vegetation has been destroyed must be immediately 
replaced with new plants.  If any mechanical 
measures are being used to prevent erosion, they 
must also be maintained to prevent any more damage. 
 
Pests and Potential Problems 
'Ruby' redosier dogwood has few problems with 
disease or insect pests.  There has been some problem 
with cicadas stinging the stems.  Lesions and cankers 
may also occur.  However, these are not pathogenic 
and are thought to just be  the tree's reaction to injury. 
 
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and 
area of origin) 
'Ruby' (NY) redosier dogwood was released in 1988 
from the Big Flats, NY Plant Materials Center.  It is 
available from commercial nurseries.
