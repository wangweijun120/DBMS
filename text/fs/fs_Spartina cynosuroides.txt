Description 
Grass Family (Poaceae).  Big cordgrass is a 
warm-season, robust, rhizomatous perennial.  The 
height ranges from 3 to 10 fe et.  The leaf blade is flat 
and 1/2 to 1 inch wide; often 18 to 24 inches long; 
rough and sharp margin.  Th e leaf sheath is rounded.   The ligule has short membrane and densely hairy.  
The stem is thick, round and often 3/4 inch in 
diameter at base.  The seedhead has 20 to 40 spikes, 
each about 3 inches long, an
d spikelets about 1/2 inch 
long growing on one side of rachis with the seedhead 
growing 12 to 18 inches long. 
 
Management 
For best production and plant vigor, graze big 
cordgrass during fall and winter and defer grazing 
during summer. 
 
Establishment 
Major growth is from late March through September 
or October.  Seedheads form during fall.  The base of 
the plant remains green through the winter.  It 
reproduces from robust rhizomes, which form dense 
colonies.  This plant is primarily adapted to mineral 
soils in salt marshes.  It tolerates moderate salinity 
and water levels that fluctuate from 4 inches below 
soil surface to 2 inches above.   It is closely associated 
with marsh-hay cordgrass ( Spartina patens) and 
common reed ( Phragmites australis ).
