Description 
Grass Family (Poaceae).  Florida dropseed is a 
native, warm-season, perennial bunch grass.  The 
height ranges from 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 feet.  The leaf blade  is mostly basal, wide, and folded at the base.  The 
upper part is usually flat, slightly twisted with 
saw-toothed bristles on the edge.  The leaf sheath is 
keeled, the basal ones hairy at
 the throat, and the base 
hard and shining.  The ligule is hairy.  The seedhead 
is an open panicle 12 to 20 inches long and only 1 or 
2 seed stalks are produced from single bunch.

winter and on which grazing is deferred during the 
summer.  Burning does not easily damage Florida 
dropseed. 
 
Establishment 
Growth starts in the late spring.  It produces 
seedheads in October.  It usually scattered throughout 
plant community, although pure stands do occur.  It is 
adapted to poorly drained soils that have a low pH.
