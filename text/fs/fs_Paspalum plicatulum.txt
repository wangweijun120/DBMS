Description 
Grass Family (Poaceae).  Brownseed paspalum is a 
warm-season, rhizomatous perennial, native to the 
U.S.  The height ranges from 2 to 4 feet.  The leaf 
blade is slightly folded; stiff; bluish green; 8 to 20 
inches long; smooth and hairy near base.  The leaf 
sheath is compressed; smooth; papery and slightly 
purple at base.  The ligule has brown membrane 1/8 
inch long.  The stem is compressed and often 
purplish at base.  The seedhead has 3 to 7 racemes 
with each 2-1/2 to 3 inches long.  Mature seeds are 
dark brown and spikelet s are extremely cross-
wrinkled on the flat side. 
 
Management 
This grass responds to grazing deferments of about 
30 days.  It decreases under continuous grazing. 
 
Establishment 
Growth starts during late winter and early spring.  
New growth is usually mixed with old growth.  It 
produces seedheads from early summer until frost.  
Mature seedheads are mixed with green leaves and 
new seedheads.  In Florida, basal leaves stay green all 
winter.  It reproduces from short rhizomes and from 
seed.  It grows well on strongly acid to neutral, 
poorly drained, clay loam  soils, and on excessively 
drained, deep, sandy soils.  It grows in the 
mountainous region of Puerto Rico on clay soils.
