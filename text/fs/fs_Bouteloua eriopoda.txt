Uses 
Black grama is a choice forage grass grazed by all 
livestock.  It is cut for hay on some ranges in wet 
seasons. 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plantâ€™s 
current status, such as, state noxious status and 
wetland indicator values. 
 
Description 
Grass Family (Poaceae).  Black grama is a native, 
warm-season, stoloniferous perennial grass.  The 
height is between 10 and 20 inches.  The leaf blade is 
narrow and rolls inward during dry periods, giving it 
a threadlike appearance.  Th e leaf sheath is short and 
clasps the stem tightly.  The ligule is a ring of short 
hairs.  The stem is solid, the lower half of the 
internodes woolly, and the upper half smooth.  The 
seedhead is 3 to 8 spikes per seedhead and 18 to 20 
spikelets per spike. 
 
Distribution : For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site. 
 
Management 
Overgrazing easily kills this grass.  To improve black 
grama ranges, defer grazing two successive years 
during the growing season and do not graze more 
than 50 percent of current growth by weight during 
dormancy.  To maintain ranges, defer grazing for one 
growing season every third year. 
 
Establishment 
During mild winters and with adequate moisture, 
lower stems stay green all winter.  New leaves grow 
from buds at nodes on stolons and from auxillary 
buds at basal nodes.  The seeding habits are not 
dependable.  In some years,  when a good seed crop is 
produced, seed viability is low.  It reproduces 
primarily from stolons.  A healthy plant generally 
produces 6 to 9 stolons.  Two favorable successive 
growing seasons are required for reproduction by 
stolons: First year, to produce stolons; second year, 
for stolons to take root and establish new plants.  It 
generally grows in pure stands.  It grows mostly on 
dry gravelly or sandy soils and seldom grows on clay 
loams or adobe (clay) flats.  Black grama is 
characteristically a lower altitude grass (3,500  to 
5,500  feet elevation), but occasionally grows at 
elevations of 7,000 feet.
