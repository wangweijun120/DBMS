GREEN SILKYSCALE
Anthaenantia villosa (Michx.) 
Beauv.  
Plant Symbol = ANVI4  
 
Contributed By: USDA NRCS National Plant Data 
Center 
 
 Alternate Name 
green silkyscale  
 
Uses 
Green silkyscale is seldom abundant enough to be a 
key management species but it adds variety to 
livestock diet.  Cattle graze it readily during summer, 
fall, and early winter.  It is an indicator of good range 
condition.  Adapts to well-drained upland soils. 
 
Status 
Please consult the PLANTS Web site and your State 
Department of Natural Resources for this plantâ€™s  current status, such as, state noxious status and 
wetland indicator values. 
 
Description 
Green silkyscale is a native, warm-season, 
rhizomatous perennial grass.  The height is between 2 
and 4 feet.  The leaf blade is
 4 to 12 inches long; light 
green; a distinct fringe of silky hair along edge; and 
twists and curls particularly when young.  The leaf 
sheath is chiefly basal, rounded, and with an obscure 
collar.  The ligule is ridge-like membrane with a 
dense ring of short hair.  The stem is round and 
slender.  The seedhead is a slender panicle, pale 
green with oval spikelets  covered with short, stiff 
hairs. 
 
Distribution : For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site. 
 
Management 
This grass decreases when  closely grazed throughout 
its growing season.  To maintain this species in the 
plant community, defer grazing 70 to 90 days every 3 
to 4 years during the growing season.  Foliage can be 
burned if done during the dormant season and no 
more than every 2 to 3 years.  Grazing should be 
deferred 90 days during the spring growing season 
following a burn. 
 
Establishment 
Green silkyscale growth starts slowly in spring and 
becomes more prominent during summer.  It forms 
loose colonies, forms seedheads in the fall, and 
becomes dormant in the  fall and winter.  The 
seedstalks break off and disa ppear in the winter.  It 
grows throughout the South from the 30-inch rainfall 
belt eastward and is adapted to well-drained upland 
soils.
