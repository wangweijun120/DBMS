Description 
Grass Family (Poaceae).  Tumble windmill grass is a 
native, warm-season, perennial bunch grass.  The 
height ranges from 4 to 12 inches.  The leaf blade is 
crowded at the base, 3 to 7 inches long, tightly 
folded, abruptly pointed, and light green.  The leaf 
sheath is shorter than the internodes, compressed, and 
flattened.  The stem is erect or decumbent and 
sometimes roots at the lower nodes.  The seedhead 
has 7 to 10 slender spikes, 2 to 6 inches long, 
arranged in 1 to 3 whorls, finally widely spreading, 
and each spikelet is tipped with a short awn.

Management 
If grazed during dormancy,  supplement with protein 
and mineral concentrates.  Its quality is moderately 
high, but production is low.  It is not a choice forage 
plant, but is important as an indicator of fair to poor 
range condition.  This grass is seldom, if ever, a key 
management species.  When it is, it responds to 
proper grazing use and deferred grazing periods of 50 
to 60 days. 
 
Establishment 
Growth starts in spring and it becomes dormant in the 
fall.  It may produce two seed crops during the 
growing season, the first from May to July and then 
the second in September.  The seedheads break off at 
maturity and tumble in the wind.  It is adapted to a 
wide range of soils, though it is best adapted to acid 
to neutral medium- and coarse-textured soils.
