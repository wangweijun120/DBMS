Description 
Grass Family (Poaceae).  Pineland threeawn is a 
cool-season, perennial bunch grass native to the U.S.  
The height is between 1-1/2 and 2-1/2 feet.  The leaf 
blade is mostly basal; 12 to 20 inches long; narrow; 
rolled inward; wiry; and hairy on upper side at base.  
The ligule is hairy.  The seedhead is a slender panicle 
10 to 12 inches long; glumes have 3 awns about 1/2 
to 3/4 inch long, one a little longer than other two. 
 
Distribution : For current distribution, please consult 
the Plant Profile page for this species on the 
PLANTS Web site. 
 
Management 
This grass increases slowly  on areas burned annually 
and grazed all year.  It decreases on areas grazed 
heavily in early spring  and on which grazing is 
deferred during summer and early fall.  Double 
chopping with heavy rolling cutters in early spring 
easily reduces it. 
 
Establishment 
Pineland threeawn growth starts in January in south 
Florida and in early March in Georgia and is rapid.  
The leaf blades usually grow 6 to 8 inches in 4 weeks 
and the seedheads appear during May and June.  
Pineland threeawn is a poor seed producer and a low 
forage producer.  It tolerates shade.  Occasionally 
short, thin rhizomes develop on plants that have been 
burned repeatedly.  It grows on well-drained sands 
over finer textured subsoil and on sands covered with 
shallow water for part of the year.  It does well on 
moderate to well-drained strongly acid soils.
